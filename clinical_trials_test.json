The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of this program to educate patients on the risks and benefits of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing, on their subsequent level of comfort with their decision about whether to receive PSA testing, and on the comfort level of physicians on their patient's decisions regarding PSA testing, and importantly, how well these strategies can be implemented into the daily work-flow of a clinic.

    "BriefSummary": "Malaria in pregnancy contributes substantially to maternal anaemia and low birth weight: effective malaria control in pregnancy could avoid about 10,000 maternal and up to 200,000 infant deaths every year. Intermittent preventive treatment with the drug sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP), administered at least twice during routine antenatal clinics, is recommended by the World Health Organization for areas of moderate to high malaria transmission, including Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nStudies carried out in Kenya and Malawi before 2004 had showed that two doses of IPTp-SP significantly reduce maternal anaemia, placental malaria parasitaemia and low birth weight. However, in countries where this strategy had been introduced as part of national policy, the coverage of the target population has varied widely, with estimates of 33-93% for uptake of one dose and 24-68% for two doses, and no country had reached the goal of 80% of pregnant women receiving at least 2 doses of IPTp. New approaches designed to improve IPTp coverage were therefore urgently needed.\n\nThis study was therefore set up in 2002, in order to evaluate the additional effect of a targeted promotional campaign on antenatal clinics utilization and on coverage and uptake of Intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in a rural health district in Burkina Faso; and to investigate the effectiveness of intermittent preventive treatment with the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine compared with weekly chloroquine, in order to provide additional evidence to the Burkinab\u00e9 Ministry of Health for an impending policy change.",

Cervical infections that do not go away may cause disease that can turn into cancer after many years.\n* Only one study has been done in Nigeria to learn how many women have HPV infection. The results of the study differed from most other studies in the world because older women were much more likely to be infected. This study with learn whether the results found in the previous study are true in Irun also, the site of the current study.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* To examine the age distribution of HPV infection and relationship to cancer of the cervix among Nigerian women.\n* To understand how different screening methods, including HPV testing, could best reduce the risk of cervical cancer in Nigerian women.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- Women residing in Irun, Nigeria, who are 15 years of age or older.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Participants complete a brief questionnaire related to demographics, household and living conditions and a longer survey with questions related to reproductive history, family history, illnesses, stressful life events and sexual history (U. of Michigan collaboration).\n* Participants have a cervical examination, HPV test, Pap test and blood test.\n* Women whose tests show they are infected with HPV or have cervical disease will do the following:\n* see a doctor and have cervical biopsies of all white abnormal areas (removal of a small tissue sample from the cervix)\n* have photographs of the cervix taken\n* have a cervical scraping for a new kind of HPV test.\n* Some women with normal test results are also asked to see a doctor to check the validity of the testing\n* Women with cervical disease receive treatment by a specialist and remain in the program until treatment is successfully completed or a final diagnosis is reached.\n* Participants may be contacted for followup up to 5 years after the final diagnosis is made.",

This is done by placing very tiny catheters or tubes into the prostate and then inserting temporary radioactive seeds, called Iridium 192, through these catheters. HDR brachytherapy gives precise radiation to the prostate with less radiation given to the normal tissues near the prostate. For patients who have been treated with external beam radiation to the prostate before, HDR brachytherapy can give radiation again to the prostate without exposing the normal tissues around the prostate to significantly more radiation. This may be safer than giving external beam radiation again. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of high dose rate temporary brachytherapy (HDR) for prostate cancer that has come back after external beam radiation.

    "BriefSummary": "Combined spinal-epidural (CSE) for labor analgesia has been used for many years and is practiced commonly at our institution, especially when the patient requests immediate pain relief. CSE is not only beneficial for its faster onset of analgesia, but also it is favorable in relation to the need for rescue analgesia, urinary retention, and rate of instrumental delivery compared to the traditional epidural. Despite its beneficial effects, there is a risk of about 15-30% of developing abnormal fetal heart rate following CSE. This is self-resolving with minimal or no intervention. Although the cause of fetal bradycardia is not fully elucidated, variations in uterine artery blood flow after epidural analgesia are thought to be due to the interaction of numerous events related to blockade of sympathetic innervations, fluid administration, maternal hypotension, uterine vascular effects of sympathetic block, fluctuations in circulating catecholamines, and possibly the effect of opioids. Similar mechanism is thought to be a cause of fetal bradycardia after the CSE with its faster onset and superior block.\n\nMaternal or fetal circulation during labor can be assessed using continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound to monitor maternal uterine artery (UtA) and fetal umbilical artery (UmA) velocity waveforms to detect changes in blood flow. The velocimetry indices mentioned above have been often used to assess the changes in the blood flow before and after the induction of epidural analgesia during labor in several studies. Although there are some studies regarding the effect of labor epidural analgesia using velocimetry indices, but there is currently no published study evaluating velocimetry indices of uterine and umbilical arteries before and after the induction of CSE. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the impact of CSE to maternal and fetal blood flow to evaluate the relationships.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that both uterine artery and umbilical artery blood flow are reduced after the induction of CSE, which may be responsible for the occurrence of fetal bradycardia.",

The common convention surrounding gains in skeletal muscle size and strength is that heavy weights are needed. In contrast, lifting lighter weights are thought to be required to induce muscular endurance and not to promote growth. However, it has previously been shown in untrained men that lifting lighter weights results in similar gains in muscle mass and strength as lifting heavier weights. The purpose of this study is to examine how performing resistance training of different intensities (light or heavy weights) affects the degree of muscle growth and strength gain in individuals who are already resistance training.\n\nThis information will be valuable when designing exercise protocols for increasing muscle size and strength at all ages, or in individuals returning from injury, as a way to stimulate muscle growth and promote strength gains without the need to lift heavy weights.",

    "BriefSummary": "A key feature of low-dose brachytherapy is that irradiation affects only a local area around the inserted radiation sources. The exposure of healthy tissues around these sources is then reduced. However, the number of adverse events remains high (about 79% of patients with sexual problems and 30% of patients with urinary incontinence) and brachytherapy is no better than other treatment options for Preservation of the urethral apparatus (about 40% of patients).\n\nThe current technique for the implantation of radioactive sources, which has not been revised since the early 1980s, consists in imaging the prostate at the beginning of the intraoperative procedure with transrectal ultrasound in order to evaluate the size and shape of the prostate . This information is then used to identify the best distribution of the dose of radiation to be administered to each patient. This treatment planning step is based on a procedure where the operator manually places 50 to 100 grains of iodine in the prostate. These grains are inserted transperinally under transrectal 2D ultrasound control, using needles through a transperineal grid with several needle guides evenly spaced 5 mm apart. This is an arduous task because this manual grain placement procedure must take into account the dose to be administered to the prostate without exceeding the dose limit for the surrounding organs at risk (rectum, urethra). In addition, the overestimation of the dose formality called TG-43 and the inaccurate grain placement can contribute to the creation of cold spots where no dose is administered. It may be responsible for recurrences of prostate cancer after brachytherapy treatment. Although brachytherapy dosimetry has been extensively researched, the TG-43 dose formalism has been the benchmark for the last 20 years. Moreover, from an economic point of view, the high side-effects rates of the treatment of prostate cancer result in particularly expensive post-treatment costs. The search for improved solutions for the treatment of prostate cancer remains a major societal challenge.\n\nIn recent years, a very attractive therapeutic alternative between active surveillance and overall treatment is gaining popularity among experts: focal therapy.\n\nIt is a localized treatment, limited to cancerous areas, in order to preserve healthy functional tissues inside and outside the organ and thus the quality of life of the patient.\n\nFocal therapy is also often the preferred solution for recovery therapy (second intervention).\n\nFinally, focal therapy has great potential to reduce the cost and duration of the intervention, as well as the cost of follow-up.\n\nIn recent years, several energies have been proposed as being adapted to focal therapy, such as high intensity focal ultrasound, laser ablation and cryotherapy. Brachytherapy, which already gives above average results in the treatment of whole glands, has been identified as a very good candidate for this new therapeutic paradigm.\n\nIn brachytherapy, radioactive grains are implanted in the prostate using transperineal catheters. The rapid reduction of the dose according to the distance of the radioactive seeds gives the physician a great flexibility to control the radiation accurately. It allows intermediate approaches between global and focal treatments, providing great scalability, and it is a good candidate for recovery therapy.\n\nRecent studies have shown that focal brachytherapy allows more than half of the needles and seeds to act more strongly on the target while irradiating Significantly less The urethra and rectum. Clinical studies on this subject are still limited and further research is needed to confirm the performance of this approach.",

    "BriefSummary": "Certain functional properties of cereal products, e.g. their postprandial glucose and insulin responses, have been characterized as steps towards obtaining a greater understanding of their beneficial health effects. A low-glycemic index diet results in decreased postprandial insulin and glucose responses, which is thought to be beneficial for insulin and glucose metabolism.\n\nIn healthy subjects, it has been shown that rye breads (RBs) produce a lower postprandial insulin response compared with refined wheat breads (RWB) despite similar glucose responses. Juntunen et al. (2003) suggested that the difference in the structural characteristics between rye and wheat breads is a possible explanatory mechanism. However, the underlying mechanism of this discrepancy between insulin and glucose responses to rye bread, the so-called \"rye factor\" (RF), is still largely unknown. Faster starch digestibility and higher postprandial insulin responses for RWB compared with RBs may indicate faster intestinal glucose absorption and faster glucose disappearance respectively.\n\nTherefore our hypothesis is that despite having similar glucose responses, RWB has faster turn over (kinetics) compared with RBs. The present study is aiming to apply an experimental set up which can comprehend the hypothetical differences in RWB and RBs kinetics.",

However, the combined benefits of consuming both plant sterols and omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil on blood cholesterol and triglycerides has not been investigated previously, except in one study where the methodology used was not the most appropriate for testing such a combination. In addition, most studies on plant sterol efficacy realised so far were done in Western countries. The present study will investigate the efficacy of plant sterols and omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil on improving the cardiovascular risk profile of Indian adults with dyslipidemia.\n\nIt is expected that, after 4 weeks of intervention, men consuming both plant sterols and omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil will have a lower cardiovascular risk profile than men receiving only plant sterols or only fish oil or none of these dietary supplements.",

Potential applications of such concept are therefore related to disease conditions comprising low lipid digestion due to lipase activity insufficiency.\n\nIn the present study, in order to see the response information for eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) delivery, EPA will be provided either as a mixture of free monoacylglycerols or as triacylglycerol (TAG).

It has been suggested that these biases may act as a vulnerability factor for the development and maintenance of body dissatisfaction and may therefore be an important target for intervention. Previous studies have demonstrated the capacity to modify the patterns of attention allocation to threatening stimuli in a variety of anxiety disorders, with a subsequent and sustained reduction in anxiety symptoms. Thus, the present study aimed at testing the efficacy of attention training in reducing attentional biases and eating disorder symptoms in individuals with elevated levels of body image disturbance and eating disorder symptomatology of clinical severity. Thirty-two participants were randomly allocated to receive eight sessions of a 10-minute computer task aimed at training their attention away from weight-related stimuli or a control placebo training condition. Results showed that participants in the attention training group had a significantly greater reduction in their attentional bias and body dissatisfaction from pre- to post-training relative to the placebo condition. At follow-up, both groups showed a significant decrease in body dissatisfaction from their pre-training levels. The only significant difference between groups in eating disorder symptoms at follow-up was in terms of the attention training group experiencing a greater reduction in weight and shape concerns.",

We want to instruct women with advanced cancer who have low self-advocacy to self-advocate for their health and well-being. We will test a new \"serious game\" or video program that teaches self-advocacy skills through interactive, situation-based activities. The goal of the Strong Together serious game is to engage participants in challenges commonly experienced by women with advanced cancer, offer them choices to self-advocate or not, and directly show them the health and social benefits of self-advocating and the negative consequences of not self-advocating. Through engaging in the Strong Together program, participants vicariously learn the essential skills of self-advocacy, understand the downstream effects of using or not using these skills, and learn distinct behaviors that they can then use to address their own challenges.",

It is associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal (death, eclampsia, abruptio placenta, HELLP syndrome) and perinatal (perinatal death, growth restriction, prematurity) outcomes. The only definite treatment of PE remains pregnancy termination. Therefore, prevention of PE remains an important challenge. Low dose aspirin may be used in the prevention of PE, particularly in women who had a severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks. Its efficiency, however, is very weak. Recently, it has been suggested that low molecular weight heparin might be useful in the prevention of PE.\n\nThe aim of this study is to analyze the usefulness of the enoxaparin 4000 UI/day in the prevention of a composite maternal or perinatal morbidity (occurrence of one of the following events: maternal death, PE, fetal growth retardation, abruptio placenta, perinatal death) in women who previously had a severe preeclampsia at less than 34 weeks' gestation. To answer this question, the investigators propose to conduct a multicenter prospective randomized trial that will compare two groups in parallel: a group where women will have an association of enoxaparin 4000 U/day and aspirin 100 mg/day and another group where women would have only aspirin 100 mg/day.

The purpose of this study is to operationalize the AACORN paradigm to promote improvements in weight status and health through a civic engagement approach. To achieve this, participants will meet in church-based Change Clubs and be led through a 6 month curriculum, which includes both lessons in cardiovascular risk reduction and a civic engagement project. Civic engagement may lead to change in individual health behaviors by increasing self-regulation and self-efficacy. The investigators will measure club members' adherence to the Change Club intervention, defined as average number of sessions attended, retention in the clubs, satisfaction with the Change Club experience and achievement of at least 50% of self-identified benchmarks for community change within 6 months. In addition the investigators will compare anthropometric factors, diet and physical activity behaviors, blood pressure, cardiorespiratory fitness, and psychosocial factors before and after participation in the Change Club intervention.",

    "BriefSummary": "Autoregulation is the ability of a vascular bed to maintain blood flow despite changes in perfusion pressure. For a long time it had been assumed that the choroid is a strictly passive vascular bed, which shows no autoregulation. However, recently several groups have identified some autoregulatory capacity of the choroid. Choroidal autoregulation was first shown in a rabbit model where intraocular pressure (IOP) and arterial blood pressure could be varied independently. In these experiments regulation of choroidal blood flow was not only dependent on ocular perfusion pressure, but was also dependent on the value of IOP. This indicates that a myogenic mechanism contributes to choroidal autoregulation, because the regulatory capacity is dependent on the transmural pressure. In the model of myogenic autoregulation arterioles change their vascular tone depending on the pressure inside the vessel and outside the vessel. The present experiments are designed to test whether a myogenic mechanism may also be involved in choroidal autoregulation in humans. For this purpose the investigators perform experiments during which the IOP and the arterial blood pressure is increased. According to the myogenic theory of autoregulation one would expect stronger vasoconstriction at lower IOPs for the same increase in ocular perfusion pressure.",

Half of all women and 30% of all men will suffer a fracture related to osteoporosis during their lifetime. While medical prevention of this immense problem is impossible at population level, it is necessary to find efficient preventive strategies. Exercise is one of the major prevention approaches because one reason behind the increasing burden of osteoporosis is the modern sedentary lifestyle. However, the optimal type, intensity, frequency, and duration of exercise that best enhances skeletal integrity are still largely unknown.\n\nWe conducted a 12-month population-based randomized controlled exercise intervention in 120 premenopausal women. The aim was to investigate the effect of impact exercise on bone mineral density, geometry and metabolism in healthy women with the intention of assessing the intensity and amount of impact loading with a novel accelerometer-based measurement device. Training effects on risk factors of osteoporotic fractures, physical performance and risk factors of cardiovascular diseases were also evaluated.\n\nThis study demonstrated that 12 months of regular impact exercise favoured bone formation, increased bone mineral density in weight-bearing bones, especially at the hip, and led to geometric adaptations by increasing periosteal circumference. Bone adaptations had a dose- and intensity-dependent relationship with measured impact loading. Changes in proximal femur were threshold-dependent, indicating the importance of high impacts exceeding acceleration of 4 g as an osteogenic stimulus. The number of impacts needed to achieve this stimulation was 60 per day. Impact exercise also had a favourable effect on physical performance and cardiorespiratory risk factors by increasing maximal oxygen uptake, dynamic leg strength and decreasing low-density lipoproteins and waist circumference. Changes were dose-dependent with impact loading at wide intensity range.\n\nBone adapts to impact loading through various mechanisms to ensure optimal bone strength. The number of impacts needed to achieve bone stimulation appeared to be 60 per day, comparable to the same number of daily jumps. If done on a regular basis, impact exercise may be an efficient and safe way of preventing osteoporosis.",

    "BriefSummary": "There has been an increasing awareness about the need to practice some physical activity, including several objectives, mainly as a preventive character. From this perspective, notice the use of the Pilates method as an instrument of therapeutic exercise for the protection and promotion of health. However, despite being popularly performed, there is still no scientific evidence on the standardization of the use of the method and its progression to an adequate prescription of physical training. The objective is monitoring the progression of loads of a 12-week training among the basic, intermediate and advanced levels of the Pilates method through heart rate (HR), subjective exertion perception (PSE) and heart rate variability (HRV). In addition, analyzing the effect of the method on cardiorespiratory and autonomic parameters. 40 healthy men aged 18-36 will receive Pilates training for 12 weeks. After the initial assessment and familiarization with the method, the training period will begin totalizing 36 sessions for three months, where each class lasts approximately 1 hour. During the three months, the participants must pass through the three levels of training: Basic, Intermediate and Advanced. During each session, the investigators will initially collect: psychological questionnaire, visual analogue pain scale (VAS), and cardiorespiratory parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HR, respiratory rate and partial oxygen saturation). Throughout the session a heart rate meter will be positioned on the chest of the participant to capture HR, which will occur every five minutes together with the PSE illustrated in the model proposed by Borg. At the end of each session, the cardiorespiratory parameters will be collected again. In addition, cardiorespiratory parameters and HRV will be analyzed at baseline and after three months of training. In the case of HRV analysis, linear methods in the time and frequency domain will be verified. For the statistical analysis of the cardiorespiratory and autonomic parameters in the pre and post training moments will be used paired t test for normal data or Wilcoxon test for non normal data. For the analysis of the training load will be used the correlation of Pearson or Sperman according to normality. The definition of cutoff points for the HRV and PSE indices will be obtained by the ROC curve.",

    "BriefSummary": "Body image is one of the leading concerns for young people. These concerns may can have serious consequences, including anxiety, depression, risk taking behaviours, eating disorders and suicidal ideation.\n\nAn extensive body of research highlights the negative effects associated with viewing idealistic media among adolescents. More recently, research has looked at harnessing media and technology to develop and disseminate material that counteracts these harmful effects. Using 'edutainment' (entertainment with educational content) to develop and disseminate interventions is a novel avenue of research. Micro-interventions (brief, low intensity, self-administered interventions), offer an alternative to traditional, intense interventions that may be unsuitable for milder concerns. Body image micro-interventions have proven effective at providing immediate and short-term improvements in body image among women. To date, body image micro-interventions have been focused on adult samples, with little research exploring how this intervention model may cater to adolescents.\n\nThe aim of the present study is to conduct a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a brief body image video micro-intervention to improve body image and acceptance of appearance diversity among girls, in addition to appearance-related internalised racism among the Black subgroup of girls.\n\nThe body image video micro-intervention is a 3-minute episode from Girls Room; a mini-series developed to address risk factors for body image. The series was developed through a collaboration between Lena Waithe, Dove (Unilever) and the Centre for Appearance.\n\nThe comparison control group will watch a 3-minute episode from an equivalent popular series which does not contain any appearance-related content.\n\nIn addition to the outcomes of interest, post-video acceptability checks will also be assessed to determine viewers' enjoyment, engagement, and identification with the video, as well as their intent to re-engage and share.\n\nTo undertake this project, 1848 adolescent girls will be recruited via an external research agency. Female-identifying North American citizens, aged 12-18 years old will be recruited, stratified to include 50% Black and 50% non-Black adolescents. The participants will be randomised to watch either the Girls Room episode, or control episode, at either 25%, 50% or 100% length of exposure. Before watching the video, they will complete baseline measures of demographics, state body satisfaction, acceptance of diversity of appearance, and appearance-related internalised racism (Black girls only). They will then be exposed to the video, before completing the measures again (post-exposure), along with acceptability checks. Participants will then be provided with a debrief of study aims and a list of support sources.",

Periods of immobilization result in a profound loss of muscle mass and strength. This loss of muscle mass can have negative effects on health and the ability to carry out activities of daily living. Thus, it is very important to try to maintain muscle mass during muscle disuse. Recent research suggests that Fortetropin, which is an all-natural protein-fat complex made from fertilized hen egg yolks, can enhance muscle mass and strength with weightlifting in young men. In this study, we aim to investigate the safety and tolerability of Fortetropin and whether Fortetropin supplementation can reduce or prevent the loss of muscle mass during single-leg immobilization while you are wearing a knee brace. To make this decision, we require a study to compare Fortetropin to a placebo (something that contains the same amount of protein and energy as Fortetropin). The findings from this study will help us understand if Fortetropin supplementation is safe, tolerable, and can be used to slow muscle loss in people who undergo periods of muscle disuse (i.e. surgery, sickness).",

Several studies have indicated effects of ginseng on improving spermatogenesis in animals. The major mechanisms behind these effects were speculated to be anti-oxidant and anti-aging effects, as well as modulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis \\[7 - 10\\]. However, there have been no controlled human clinical trials to evaluate the effects of KRG on spermatogenesis in patients with male infertility.\n\nOnly a small proportion of causes of male infertility are currently curable, including male hypogonadal disorders that can be cured by gonadotropic agents, and obstructive azoospermia that can be corrected by surgery. In addition, evidence-based medicine has revealed that most empirical treatments are ineffective. Similarly, the efficacies of carnitine, anti-estrogens, kallikrein, vitamins C and E, and glutathione have not been confirmed.\n\nTherefore, the investigators investigated the effects of KRG on semen parameters in male infertility patients. This is the first placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the therapeutic effects of KRG in male patients.",

Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane\u00ae) is a solvent-free formulation of paclitaxel encapsulated in albumin. It does not require premedication with corticosteroids or antihistamines to prevent the risk of solvent-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. This new formulation improves safety profile, allows higher dosing with shorter infusion duration, and produces higher tumor drug concentration.\n\nAs neoadjuvant treatment does not only allow to compare competing treatment approaches with a very high quality (homogenous treatment population, precise assessment of response by histological assessment), but also to identify predictive markers, this trial will compare weekly nab-paclitaxel with solvent-based paclitaxel at their currently optimal doses.\n\nIn case of HER2-positive tumor status patients receive Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab additionally.",

Local anesthesia is a single shot injection, so additional analgesic drugs is required when the effect of local anesthetics are disappeared. Dexmedetomidine, an alpha adrenergic agonist, is commonly used in pediatric sedation. It has analgesic effect and potentiates the effect of local anesthetics. There are many studies about the potentiation of the effect of local anesthetics when added to dexmedetomidine in adults, it has been limited in pediatrics. Recent study said that local anesthetics with dexmedetomidine had prolonged duration of analgesia in caudal block, also in ilioinguinal block. Thus it is expected to have a prolonged effect when investigators use dexmedetomidine in pediatrics as well as adults.",

    "BriefSummary": "Alterations in fatty acid mobilization and oxidation may be primary adaptations responsible for the improvements in metabolic health after a single session of endurance exercise. The investigators will determine the effect of a single session of endurance exercise on whole-body fatty acid mobilization and oxidation, IMTG concentration and the expression of factors that regulate these processes in skeletal muscle of 11 women with abdominal obesity (age: 18-45y). In addition, the investigators will evaluate how these factors, and exercise, effect insulin signalling and insulin sensitivity. Every effort will be made to recruit subjects from ethnic and minority groups. Before participating in the study, subjects will be informed of all the procedures and potential risks, and they will sign an informed consent form approved by The University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. Eligible volunteers will participate in three separate trials, in a randomized order. In two trials subjects will eat exactly the same amount of calories, except in one trial they will exercise (eucaloric + exercise) and in the other trial they will remain sedentary (hypercaloric). In a third trial subjects will again remain sedentary but instead they will ingest appropriate calories to maintain caloric balance (eucaloric + sedentary). By doing this the investigators are also able to investigate the effect of acute caloric perturbations on insulin sensitivity, because it is possible that the enhanced insulin sensitivity evident after exercise, as compared to the sedentary state, is due to caloric deficit and not the exercise bout, per se.",

In recent retrospectively collected data, investigators found that in couples with unexplained and mild male factor infertility undergoing IUI, ovarian stimulation with letrozole increased live birth rate as compared to natural cycle IUI without substantially increasing the multiple pregnancy rate. Investigators therefore perform a randomized clinical trial (RCT) on the subject in the Centre of Reproductive Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.\n\nObjective: To test the hypothesis that in couples with unexplained or mild male factor infertility scheduled for an IUI program ovarian stimulation with letrozole increases the live birth rate as compared to natural cycle treatment.\n\nStudy design Randomized clinical trial.\n\nStudy population Women diagnosed with unexplained or mild male factor infertility scheduled for treatment with IUI.\n\nIntervention Women will be randomized for ovarian stimulation with letrozole or to natural cycle IUI. In the group allocated to ovarian stimulation, women will receive oral tablets letrozole 5 mg daily from cycle day 3-5 for 5 days. Investigators will treat the couples for 3 cycles, with a time horizon of 4 months.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints Primary outcome is ongoing pregnancy leading to live birth. Secondary endpoints are clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage rates, pregnancy complications and patients' costs.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness The strategies compared are already broadly applied in current practice. No additional risks are expected. There is no benefit for participants, but the results may benefit future subfertile couples.",

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of INTV and INTM on aerobic fitness variables (peak power output, Wmax, lactate threshold, and onset of blood lactate accumulation) but more importantly on performance as measured using a controlled mountain bike race, i.e. simulation. The investigators hypothesized that INTV and INTM training were equally effective in improving Wmax, Lactate threshold and onset of blood lactate accumulation, but INTV was superior in enhancing performance in mountai bike race simulation.This hypothesis is due to studies that have shown higher gains in performance with long duration of aerobic high intensity interval training in comparison to the shorter training at a higher intensity.",

The FSN intervention targets parent feeding practices, young children's diet and physical activity (PA) and early childhood (0-2 years of age) weight status, all associated with risk for early childhood obesity and, consequently, risk for obesity over the life course. The investigators will also explore whether maternal psychosocial factors (stress, depression and substance use), household food/water security and/or constrained physical activity environments moderate FSN intervention impacts on: mother's feeding behaviors for infants and toddlers; and, children's diets, PA patterns, and weight status. Finally, the investigators will examine how maternal/infant characteristics, diet and behaviors impact the underlying biologic mechanisms of early childhood obesity and whether social and behavioral interventions can impact infant metabolic health. The investigators evaluation will employ a randomized controlled design, in which both the intervention and comparison condition receive assisted transportation to prenatal and well-baby visits (called \"Optimized Standard Care\"), and the comparison condition also receives potentially beneficial injury prevention education at 8 assessment visits.\n\nPrimary Aims:\n\nEfficacy of Family Spirit Nurture (FSN) + Optimized Standard Care (OSC) versus Injury Prevention Education (IPE) + OSC will be assessed for each of the following from birth to 24 months postpartum:\n\nAim 1. Mothers' implementation of recommended feeding behaviors. Hypothesis 1. FSN + OSC mothers will be more likely to meet breastfeeding and complementary feeding recommendations and engage in responsive parenting/feeding behaviors compared to IPE + OSC mothers.\n\nAim 2. Children's consumption of healthy diet and physical activity engagement. Hypothesis 2. FSN + OSC children will consume more fruits and vegetables and fewer calories from sugar sweetened beverages (SSB), snacks and desserts, and they will have higher physical activity and reduced screen time/other sedentary activities compared to IPE + OSC children.\n\nAim 3.

However, despite the growing body of literature regarding effects of different interventions in fatigue, there is still lack of clarity regarding the efficacy of interventions on running economy and, particularly, fatigue-induced biomechanical alterations. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of massage and cold water immersion for enhancing recovery and alleviating fatigue after an exhausting training session. We hypothesized that both massage and cold water immersion would enhance biomechanical parameters compared with a control condition and hence would improve subsequent running economy.",

Studies have shown that PSMA PET/CT can detect prostate cancer lesions with excellent contrast and a high detection rate even when the level of prostate specific antigen is low. PSMA imaging is considered the gold standard in imaging of biochemical recurrence, with detection rate of recurrence in 79.5% of patients, in the largest series of 1007 patients. Despite these excellent results, there remains approximately 20% of patients in whom the site of biochemical recurrence cannot be identified and further research is needed into improving detection rates.\n\nAndrogen deprivation therapy (ADT), represents the standard of care treatment for most men with a rising serum PSA and no evidence of disseminated disease on imaging modalities. There has been some preliminary data that imaging patients early after initiation of ADT therapy may increase detection rates of recurrence sites.\n\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate if prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence and negative PSMA PET/CT can demonstrate in-vivo upregulation of PSMA receptors in an attempt to improve detection rates of recurrent prostate cancer. Patients who are started on ADT when clinically indicated, will have repeat PSMA PET/CT at 4 weeks following initiation of ADT therapy.",

Approximately 9 % of those who use cannabis will become addicted. The number goes up to about 1 in 6 among those who start using cannabis as teenagers and to 25 to 50 % among those who smoke cannabis daily. The consequences of cannabis abuse in the most prone population (14-25 years of age) are extremely serious, and may include addiction, altered brain development, poorer educational outcomes, cognitive impairment, lower income, greater welfare dependence, unemployment and lower relationship and life satisfaction. There are no available pharmacological treatments of cannabis use disorder (CUD). Thus, the development of safe and effective medications for the treatment of CUD is an urgent public health priority.\n\nThe preclinical efficacy and available ADMET (Administration, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination and Toxicology) in animal and human data suggest that AEF0117, an investigational new study drug, could constitute a very efficacious and safe treatment for cannabis abuse disorders. The purpose of this research is to study how AEF0117 influences the subjective effects of cannabis in subjects with CUD. AEF0117 acts in the same parts of the brain as THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the active ingredient of marijuana, and may temporarily alter some of cannabis's effects.\n\nThis will be a Phase 1, open-label, nonrandomized, single-dose study in healthy male subjects. Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 28 days prior to the dose administration. Subjects will be admitted into the study site on Day 1.

    "BriefSummary": "Families who experience maternal mental illness and a variety of chronic stressors are currently underserved by the parenting programs. The investigators propose that impairments in maternal self-regulation, which result in unsupportive parenting, directly impact children's own self-regulation and neurobiology, leading to risk for intergenerational transmission of mental illness. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a program that is targeted at improving underlying self-regulatory mechanisms in both mothers with depression and their 3- to 5-year-old children. It is hypothesized that children exposed to maternal mental illness will have greater self-regulatory deficits across emotional and behavioural domains compared to children not exposed to mental illness. The effects of maternal mental illness are expected to be compounded for children of mothers reporting a higher degree of chronic stressors, including poverty, housing instability, violence, and low social support. Further, it is hypothesized that taking a dual-generation intervention approach to addressing self-regulatory mechanisms underlying psychopathology at the level of the mother, child, and dyad (i.e. parenting interactions) will improve both maternal capacities and child outcomes. A feasibility study has been conducted in-person (NCT04347707). Results from this trial showed positive effects on child and mother well-being as well as parenting skills. Our current study will be conducted remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic to adhere to public health guidelines to reduce in-person contact and physical distance. The objectives for this study are two-fold: 1) establish a better understanding of the self-regulatory processes that are altered in preschool-aged children exposed to maternal mental illness, and determine the mediating role of parenting behaviours, as well as the moderating impact of chronic stress exposure; and 2) evaluate a novel dual-generation intervention for mothers with mental illness using a virtual format and their 3- to 5-year-old children based on existing gold-standard evidence-based approaches.",

Iron deficiency is the principal cause of anemia after delivery. Oral iron supplementation with ferrous sulfate has been considered the standard of care with blood transfusion reserved for more severe or symptomatic cases. In the last decade, two new intravenous iron compounds have been registered for clinical use: ferric carboxymaltose (Iroprem\u00ae) and iron isomaltoside (Monofer\u00ae).

The study will therefore be the first to include a group benefiting from these two management methods, which will make it possible to assess the individual benefit of cognitive stimulation sessions and adapted physical activity but also the benefit of combined sessions.As this type of combined management has never been the subject of a study, and previous studies relating to a single type of management having raised patient adhesion difficulties, it does not seem certain that this type of care is feasible in practice. Before studying its effectiveness, it is therefore essential to check the feasibility and acceptability of such a program combining sessions of adapted physical activity and cognitive stimulation sessions.Investigator will therefore first carry out a feasibility study, longitudinal and monocentric, which will assess the adherence of patients treated for breast cancer to the performance of cognitive stimulation sessions coupled with sessions of adapted physical activity.This feasibility study is a key stage of the Cog-Stim protocol because its results will probably highlight the obstacles to the intervention program, which will allow the investigator to propose adjustments to improve the study design for the following stages of the protocol.

    ],
    "PrimaryCompletionDate": "2011-02",
    "BriefSummary": "Rationale: The current standard of respiratory monitoring for patients during deep sedation is continuous pulse oximetry with visual assessment of the patient. Clinical research has demonstrated that depressed respiratory activity is a principal risk factor for hypoxemia during sedation. Capnography may provide early detection of alveolar hypoventilation before hypoxemia has occurred in nonintubated patients and thereby improve patient safety during sedation.\n\nObjective: At the Centre for Contraception, Sexuality and Abortion Leiden, abortion procedures are performed under deep sedation using propofol. Patient's monitoring is performed by nurses qualified in patient sedation management, using pulse oximetry and their clinical judgement. The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of capnography in early detection of alveolar hypoventilation during deep sedation in comparison to standard monitoring with pulse oximetry in abortion procedures.\n\nStudy design: This protocol describes a prospective, open, randomized controlled trial with two study arms. All patients receive standard care of monitoring performed by the medical staff. The study investigates whether capnography prevents patients from having respiratory events during deep sedation in abortion procedures by early detection and therapy. Patients randomized to the standard care group receive standard of respiratory monitoring using pulse oximetry. In the capnography arm, respiratory monitoring is performed with pulse oximetry and capnography.\n\nStudy population: The study population comprises female patients (\u2265 18 years) undergoing abortion procedures during first or second trimester pregnancies. Abortion procedures are performed until 22 weeks of gestational age.\n\nCapnography: In addition application of capnography during deep sedation with propofol is performed. Before the trial starts, all nurses qualified in patient sedation management and abortion doctors will be trained in assessment of capnography. In the capnography arm, patients' breathing is additionally monitored with capnography. If alveolar hypoventilation is detected medical staff will intervene by arousing the patient, performing chin lift, repositioning the head, provision of oxygen, or abandon from giving additional propofol. These interventions represent the standard of care currently used by the clinical staff to respond to hypoventilation and hypoxemia.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is the occurrence of oxygen saturations to \u226490% in the population, as measured by continuous pulse oximetry. Secondary study outcomes include occurrence of oxygen saturations \\< 80%, dose of administered propofol, arousal or movement of the patient during the procedure, airway interventions, early termination of the procedure due to respiratory problems, episodes of bradycardia, and administration of atropine.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: The risks related to the conduct of this study are negligible and the burden minimal. Patients in both groups receive the current standard of care. Patients randomized in the capnography group could get benefit from the addition of capnography to the monitoring by early detection of alveolar hypoventilation. Capnography is a noninvasive measurement by means of a cannula under the nose, which before the sedation may tickle, but during sedation no inconvenience is expected.",

Therefore, analyze different doses for a answer in short and long time, associated with capacities of strength, fatigue resistance and functional performance of handball players and healthy individuals becomes necessary. Objective: To analyze the effects of the application of LED photobiomodulation on the capacities of strength, functional efficiency, temperature and fatigue resistance of handball players and healthy individuals. Method: The study sample will be composed of 56 male individuals randomly allocated into four groups: LED 50J (G-50J), LED 240J (G-240J), LED 50-240J (G-50-240J) - progressive dose and Sham (G-S). The volunteers will be submitted to an evaluation of muscle performance and functional performance, metabolic, and physiological evaluation. After initial tests, in five consecutive weeks, the LEDT (940nm - infrared) will be applied to the quadriceps femoris muscle and hamstrings, bilaterally, associated with a muscle strength protocol. After 24 hours of the last application TLED, the tests will be repeated. Seven days after the last intervention will be performed a follow-up. For analysis, normality tests will be used to verify the distribution and adequate statistical tests for the appropriate intra and intergroup comparisons, being considered two factors in the comparisons, time, and group. A significance level of 5% will be adopted.",

It has been observed that conventional high dose set up regimen of gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is effective in anovulatory subjects in terms of overall pregnancy rates. However, development of multiple follicles leading to multiple pregnancy and/or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is the major complications associated with this high dose set up. Chronic low-dose (CLD) protocols of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), aimed at finding the threshold amount of FSH necessary to promote monofolliculogenesis, have been found to be successful in reducing the rate of OHSS almost to nil and the rate of multiple pregnancies to a minimum. This post-marketing study will investigate tailoring of recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (r-FSH) in a large population (N=310) of subjects from a region (North Africa/Middle East) that has not been included in previous studies of ovulation induction in subjects with chronic anovulation. The study aims to increase current knowledge of the efficacy and safety of Gonal-f, and provide fertility physicians with experience in Gonal-f treatment in anovulatory infertility, thereby contributing to the development of FSH dosing guidelines for ovulation induction by defining the optimal CLD and Low dose (LD) regimens.",

It is widely accepted that \"insulin resistance\" may be responsible for the infertility of this syndrome. Women are insulin resistant when their bodies do not respond to insulin's action to handle sugar as they normally should. Because of this insulin resistance, women with the polycystic ovary syndrome are also at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes. We have previously shown that D-chiro-inositol (DCI), a substance naturally found in our body that helps insulin's action, is lacking in women with the polycystic ovary syndrome. Not having enough DCI may lead to insulin resistance. The purpose of this study is to determine if weight loss helps to replenish the body with DCI and help to promote insulin's action.",

    "BriefSummary": "Increased core temperature (hyperthermia) has been associated with impaired neuromuscular performance; however, the mechanisms associated with these performance decrements and their potential synergies remain unclear. While the majority of research suggests that the observed fatigue is related to the central nervous system, the influence of changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and associated changes in cerebral alkalosis (estimated by end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide; PETCO2) remains unexamined. In response to hyperthermia, humans hyperventilate as means of heat dissipation, resulting in a hypocapnia (reduced PETCO2) mediated decrease in CBF and consequently, cerebral alkalosis (increased cerebral pH). Previous research suggests that hyperventilation induces changes in neural excitability and synaptic transmission; however, it remains unclear if these changes are related to hypocapnia mediated decrease in CBF or decreased PETCO2 or both.\n\nThe purpose of the proposed research program is to examine the influence of changes in CBF and cerebral alkalosis on neuromuscular function during passive heat stress. The research project will consist of 3 separate experimental trials: (a) poikilocapnic hyperthermia (increased core temperature; decrease CBF; decrease PETCO2), (b) isocapnic hyperthermia (increased core temperature; no change CBF; no change PETCO2) and (c) isocapnic hyperthermia + indomethacin (increased core temperature; decrease CBF; no change PETCO2). During each manipulation, neuromuscular function will be evaluated and compared to baseline (normothermic) conditions using a repeated measures design.\n\nIt is hypothesized that changes in PETCO2 and therefore, changes in cerebral alkalosis will contribute to neuromuscular fatigue independent of changes in CBF or increases in core temperature.",

    "BriefSummary": "Sonographic fetal weight estimation at the last weeks of third trimester in low-risk pregnancies is an effective method for diagnosis of fetal growth restriction (FGR) permitting close surveillance and timely delivery. The need for a systematic ultrasound evaluation at the last weeks of a low-risk pregnancy and the best time to perform it remains controversial. The most commonly used clinical screening tool in this population is the serial measurement of symphysis-fundus distance, which is a method of a variable and low sensitivity for detection of FGR.\n\nIn Portugal, in accordance with guidelines of Direc\u00e7\u00e3o Geral de Sa\u00fade from 2015, fetal growth restriction screening in low risk pregnancies is performed with an ultrasound for fetal weight estimation at 30th-33rd weeks. Nonetheless, recent data from randomized trials showed that FGR detection rate was superior at 36 vs 32 weeks' gestation. In cases of severe FGR, detection rate was also superior at 36 vs 32 weeks' gestation. In a prior retrospective study, our group analyzed 1429 term low risk pregnancies and the investigators concluded that small for gestational age term babies (birthweight \\< 10th centile) had a statistically significant higher rate of operative deliveries for intrapartum fetal distress than appropriate for gestational age as well as a higher rate of admission to neonatal intensive care unit. Moreover the investigators compared the same outcomes within small for gestational age neonates with antepartum detection at 30th-33rd weeks ultrasound vs undetected (normal 30th-33rd weeks ultrasound). Antepartum detection of small for gestational age neonates showed a statistically significant lower rate of operative deliveries for intrapartum fetal distress than undetected small for gestational age neonates. The investigators will conduct a prospective randomized clinical trial with the aim to evaluate if a 35th-37th weeks after the standard of care ultrasound in low risk pregnancies is effective in improving the detection rate of FGR and in reducing cesarean deliveries for intrapartum fetal distress and admission to neonatal intensive care unit.",

Prevention or delay in onset of chronic diseases can potentially benefit a large segment of the elderly population.

Therefore, inhibition of GSK-3 is able to increase \u03b2-catenin in nucleus and would be able to induce growth of hair.

    "BriefSummary": "Erenumab, a monoclonal antibody acting on the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor, is an effective and safe migraine-specific preventive drug. The use of migraine-specific preventive drugs paves the way for a novel method to study migraine pathogenesis. Migraine is a complex disorder with several genetic and epigenetic influence, including that of microRNA. Several microRNAs, including those of inflammation and of endothelial function, have high expression levels in subjects with migraine; however, the findings of the available studies are insufficient to provide epigenetic biomarkers for migraine. Besides, little evidence is available on the role of migraine preventive treatments in the expression of microRNA. The study aims at evaluating the expression profiles of microRNAs before and after erenumab treatment prescribed according to clinical indication. The study will include women with episodic or chronic migraine treated with erenumab 140 mg monthly according to the Summary of Product Characteristics and local reimbursement criteria. The study will compare the expression profile of microRNAs in women with episodic and chronic migraine; besides, it will investigate differences in migraine-associated microRNA expression according to age, migraine characteristics, pain intensity, response to erenumab, migraine-related impact and disability.",

Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood tests, bone scan if a recent one is not available, and possibly computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the pelvis. They will also have a liquid retention test, in which they are given an enema of 4 tablespoons of salt water that they must retain for 20 minutes.\n\nParticipants will receive standard radiation therapy for prostate cancer-5 consecutive days for 8 weeks-in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Radiation Oncology Clinic. Amifostine will be placed in the rectum by a mini-enema before each radiation treatment so that it covers the lining of the rectum. To determine the side effects of the treatment, patients will undergo a proctoscopic examination before beginning radiation therapy, two times during therapy, and at each follow-up visit for 5 years after treatment ends. This examination involves inserting a proctoscope (a thin flexible tube with a light at the end) into the rectum and taking pictures.\n\nPatients will be followed in the clinic at visits scheduled 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after treatment for a physical examination and routine blood tests, proctoscopic examination, and review of bowel symptoms.",

However, it has not been validated to treat prostate cancer in general or CRPC in particular.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* To determine the effects of TRC105 as a treatment for CRPC\n* To determine the safety and effectiveness of TRC105 in treating CRPC\n\nEligibility:\n\n- Men at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with castrate-resistant prostate cancer for which existing treatments have not been effective.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Eligible individuals will have a series of blood and other tests to determine their suitability for participating in the study.\n* Participants will receive intravenous infusions of TRC105 in a 28-day treatment cycle. Participants will receive i.v. (intravenous) infusions of TRC105 every two weeks on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle (cohorts 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6) and every week on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28 day cycle (cohort 4).\n* Participants will receive different doses of TRC105 depending on when they enter the study, up to a maximum tolerated dose or optimum treatment dose.\n* Frequent blood and urine tests will be performed during treatment, as well as other tests of cancer progression as directed by the study doctors. Participants will receive medicines to help prevent possible adverse side effects of TRC105, such as allergic reaction to the drug.\n* Participants will continue treatment with TRC105 until they or the study team decides that the medication is not beneficial. No additional testing will be required unless participants discontinue the treatment because of side effects (which the study doctors will follow until the side effects are resolved).",

    "BriefSummary": "This therapeutical trial will be conducted in patients with the Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS), which is mutations in MCT8.\n\nMCT8 is a thyroid hormone (TH) transporter which is crucial for the transport of TH from the blood into different tissues. Dysfunction of MCT8 results in a lack of TH (hypothyroidism) in tissues that depend on MCT8 for TH uptake. This local hypothyroidism in the brain of these patients causes severe psychomotor retardation.\n\nIn addition, TH serum parameters are highly abnormal in AHDS: high T3, low T4 and normal TSH levels. The high serum T3 levels cause local hyperthyroidism in tissues that do not depend on MCT8 for cellular transport of TH, resulting in a low body weight and reduced muscle mass.\n\nCurrently, no adequate treatment is available for the AHDS. A T3 analog that does not depend on MCT8 for its cellular entry could, at least partially, restore the abnormalities found in AHDS. Several in vivo, in vitro and animal studies have shown that the T3 analog Triac is a very promising candidate:\n\n1. Triac binds to the same TH receptors as T3;\n2. Cellular uptake of Triac does not depend on functional MCT8. Hence, in AHDS patients Triac will also be available in tissues that require functional MCT8 for TH uptake, e.g. the brain;\n3. In vitro studies have shown that neuronal cells differentiate equally well in the presence of either Triac or T3;\n4. In Mct8 deficient mice, Triac is taken up by the brain and suppresses serum TSH levels; consequently, serum T3 and T4 levels were lowered;\n5. Triac is the treatment of choice in patient with the resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) syndrome. Patient with RTH have high serum TSH and thyroid hormone levels, which shows strong similarities to the profile found in AHDS patients; the longstanding experience with Triac in RTH indicates its safety and tolerability .\n\nThus, Triac treatment could result in normalization of the abnormal serum TH values in AHDS patients. Furthermore, Triac could replace the function of T3 in tissues that depend on MCT8 for TH uptake (e.g. brain).\n\nThe current trial will investigate if Triac treatment in ADHS patients\n\n1. reduces the toxic effects of the high T3 levels\n2. restores the local TH deficiency in brain.",

The accumulation of repeated disuse events in older individuals manifests in a chronic muscle anabolic resistance (i.e. the inability of muscle to respond to anabolic stimuli such as exercise and nutrition) that may underpin the slow but devastating process of age-related muscle loss.\n\nIt is our belief that strategies to promote muscle health in ageing and reduce healthcare expenditure, should focus on alleviating muscle deterioration and anabolic resistance during short-term disuse.\n\nIn this regard, we propose that resistance exercise (i.e. weight lifting) performed prior to a disuse event (termed 'prehabilitation') may be sufficient to offset muscle loss in older individuals. Thus, we suggest the potent effect of resistance exercise in older muscles may prevent muscle loss during short-term disuse.",

The novel approach will incorporate one of two protocols utilizing medications that provide maximal ovarian stimulation but have a temporary detrimental fertility-reducing effect on the endometrium. If ovarian stimulation is adequate, oocyte retrieval will be performed and viable oocytes vitrified (stored in a \"glass-like\" state in liquid nitrogen). At a later time, oocyte warming and fertilization will be performed in a subsequent cycle, in which the endometrium has been prepared.\n\nKey points include:\n\n* Randomization to one of two ovarian stimulation protocols that have been shown to have a detrimental effect on the endometrium, and therefore are rarely used in a \"fresh\" IVF cycle\n* Oocyte vitrification is considered to be an investigational procedure by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), and should only be performed under the supervision of an IRB. With oocyte vitrification, ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval can \"unlinked\" from embryo transfer, allowing embryo transfer to occur in a more optimal environment\n* Endometrial preparation is routine for frozen embryo transfer",

Where maternal mortality is high and resources are limited, the introduction of low-cost, evidence-based practices for primary prevention of PPH is an urgent need. Controlled cord traction (CCT) is actively promoted in combination with prophylactic uterotonics for the prevention of PPH. While the administration of uterotonics has been proven effective, there is no evidence of CCT being beneficial or safe. The investigators propose this study to evaluate two primary questions:\n\n1. In women having term, single vaginal deliveries in hospital settings, in whom the third stage is managed with prophylactic oxytocin, does CCT produce a clinically significant reduction in the incidence of postpartum blood lose?\n2. In these women, does CCT produce a clinically significant increase in the incidence of severe complications, including uterine inversion or the need for subsequent surgical evacuation of retained placental tissues and membranes (curettage or manual removal)?\n\nTo answer these two questions we designed two arms randomized controlled trial.",

(1) Although preterm labor constitutes only 10% of total labors, yet 70% of infant's mortality is related to prematurity. It is therefore one of the international indices in assessment of health condition worldwide. Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (H.C.G.) is a heterodimeric glycoprotein produced primarily in the placenta and has multiple endocrines, paracrine and immunoregulatory actions. (3) The importance of H.C.G. in maintenance of early pregnancy has been widely accepted, reports have highlighted a potential role of H.C.G. in maintaining uterine quiescence in the third trimester. H.C.G. exerts a potent concentration dependent inhibitory effect on human myometrial contractions. (4) Recent data suggests that H.C.G. might have a role as an endogenous tocolytic agent in normal pregnancy. A significant decrease in serum H.C.G. level was found 2-3 weeks before the spontaneous onset of labour. This might contribute to increasing the contractility in the uterine muscle and gradually initiating the onset of labour. (5)",

Traditionally prior to prostate biopsy, an antibiotic, ciprofloxacin, has been given to men to prevent biopsy-related infections. In recent years as ciprofloxacin resistance has increased in the community, more and more men are becoming infected with ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria after prostate biopsy. This study is being done to determine if obtaining rectal swab cultures and choosing antibiotics based on these culture results will result in fewer infectious complications than giving all men ciprofloxacin.\n\nThe investigators will compare 2 groups: men whose rectal swabs do not show ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria will receive ciprofloxacin prior to biopsy, and men whose swabs do show ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria will receive alternative antibiotics based on their culture results. Our hypothesis is that these 2 groups will have equal numbers of post-biopsy infectious complications and both groups will have fewer infectious complications than a historical group who received empiric ciprofloxacin without the benefit of rectal swab culture results.",

    "BriefSummary": "Minimal data are available on protein requirements throughout the lifespan. Currently available recommendations are based on nitrogen balance data. The limitations of the nitrogen balance method have been well described. Importantly, nitrogen balanced underestimates requirements.\n\nThe current dietary reference intakes (DRI) requirement for healthy adult males is based on the reanalysis of the nitrogen balance date from Young and Scrimshaw. This data was reanalyzed statistically by Rand et al. and he concluded that the protein requirement of healthy adults was 0.65 and 0.83 (mean and RDA) g/kg/day of good quality protein. Using indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO), our group estimated the protein requirement of young men (mean age 27 years) to be 0.93 and 1.2 g/kg/day (mean and RDA).\n\nCurrently there are no studies on protein requirement in the elderly. In a recent nutrition survey conducted by national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES), the authors concluded that adults between the ages of 51 - 70 years old consumed an average on 1.0 g/kg/day (ideal body weight) of protein which represents about 15 % of calories. Depending on the calculations used for ideal body weight some older adults could be getting higher or lower than requirement. There is no scientifically derived protein estimate for older adults. Therefore there is a need to measurer protein requirement in that population.\n\nThe goal of this study therefore is to measure the protein requirement of male elderly subjects between the ages of 65 - 75 years using the IAAO technique.",

    "BriefSummary": "Improvements in early detection and successful treatment of breast cancer have lead to a steady rise in the number of breast cancer (BC) survivors. With so many individuals living for extended periods after diagnosis, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends the implementation of treatment summaries and survivorship care plans (TSSPs) as a mechanism to improve ongoing clinical and coordination of care, and to address the immediate post-treatment and long-term effects of cancer treatment, including the ongoing psychosocial burden of a cancer diagnosis. The need for TSSPs has also been strongly advocated by the American Society of Clinical Oncology's Quality Oncology Practice Initiative and TSSPs have been included in the recently introduced Comprehensive Cancer Improvement Act (H.R. 1844). This will be one of the first randomized controlled trials to test the efficacy of TSSPs.\n\nThe investigators will recruit 500 low income, medically underserved women from two county public hospitals, LAC+USC Medical Center and Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, 10-24 months after breast cancer diagnosis for participation in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to test the efficacy of TSSPs. The investigators will randomize these women into one of two groups: 1) a control condition of usual medical care and 2) an experimental condition of the control condition + a tailored TSSP + 1 face-to-face nurse counseling session, with all cancer specialists and primary care physicians of record also receiving the TSSP and a cover letter suggesting how they can be clinically utilized.\n\nThe investigators specific aims are to assess and compare between experimental and control groups the following primary outcomes at one year post-intervention: 1) discussion and implementation of recommended breast cancer survivorship care, including surveillance and the evaluation and management of BC treatment-related symptoms, 2) patient satisfaction with survivorship communication and care, 3) pertinent aspects of health-related quality of life, and further, to then 4) assess the cost-consequences of the experimental intervention. This study will provide a unique opportunity to assess the efficacy of TSSPs in a low-income, underserved population of BC survivors known to be at high risk for poorer long-term outcomes, including in mental health, quality of life, recurrence and mortality, and will therefore allow us to demonstrate the greatest possible benefit of such an intervention.",

    "BriefSummary": "Rationale: The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is strongly increasing in developed countries. The role of the small intestine seems important in the development of the metabolic syndrome. Although it is known that a high-fat Western-style of diet has deleterious effects on (post-prandial) lipidemia and glucose homeostases, effects of such a diet on the small intestine is not known. To elucidate the role of the small intestine on the early development of the metabolic syndrome, the effects of a high-fat (HF) and a low-fat (LF) diet will be examined on gene expression in the small intestine and early biomarkers in blood of healthy subjects.\n\nObjective: The objective of this study is to compare in healthy subjects the effects of a HF diet (40 En% fat) with those of a LF diet (20 En% fat) on early biomarkers and parameters of metabolic stress in blood and on expression of genes in the small intestine.\n\nAdditional research objectives are:\n\n* To compare the diet-induced changes in transcriptome profile of the small intestine with more easily accessible peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)\n* To establish effects of HF and LF diet on basal gut permeability and after a chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) load (second hit).\n\nStudy design: Randomised crossover design. The duration of the experimental periods (HF and LF diet) will be 28 days, separated by a wash out period of at least 3 weeks. At day 21 of each intervention period a postprandial test will be performed and duodenum biopsies will be taken. At day 25 and 28 of each intervention period, respectively, basal gut permeability and gut permeability after a CDCA load will be determined with a sugar recovery test.\n\nStudy population: Ten healthy men in the age of 18-60 years, without a history of any gastrointestinal disorders or complaints.\n\nIntervention: Subjects will consume in random order:\n\n* a HF diet (40 En% fat, 45 En% carbohydrates and 15 En% proteins)\n* a LF diet (20 En% fat, 65 En% carbohydrates and 15 En% proteins)\n\nPrimary study parameters/endpoints: Potential early biomarkers of the metabolic syndrome in blood and gene expression profiles in the small intestine.\n\nSecondary study parameters/endpoints: Parameters of the metabolic syndrome in blood, gene expression profiles in PBMC and gut permeability.",

The main reason for selecting spinal anaesthesia as the first choice for laparoscopic cases was its advantages over general anaesthesia which include uniform total muscle relaxation, a conscious patient, economical, relatively uneventful recovery, pain free early postoperative period and the protection from potential complications of general anaesthesia. The main debatable point, however, seems to be the status of respiratory parameters among the two modes of anaesthesia during laparoscopic surgery. In this context it can be stated that spontaneous physiological respiration during spinal anaesthesia would always be better than an assisted respiration as in general anaesthesia.\n\nThe pneumo-peritoneum induced rise in intra-abdominal pressure including pressure on the diaphragm and carbon dioxide induced peritoneal irritation are the factors to be considered",

    "BriefSummary": "Obesity is the consequence of a chronic disequilibrium of fat balance. Genetic factors determine predisposition to obesity, but the most often mentioned idea is that environmental factors, such as a high-fat diet and a sedentary lifestyle, join to favour weight gain and explain the increased prevalence of obesity in our westernized societies. Since lipogenesis is negligible in humans, obesity represents the consequence of altered fat partitioning between oxidation and storage, likely due to a preferential directing of dietary fat towards adipose tissue and away from muscle. Interventions that favour partitioning of dietary fat towards muscle for oxidation might thus protect against weight gain. Exercise may be one kind of such intervention but the scant data on dietary fat metabolism does not allow clear conclusions, in particular in obese subjects. One question concerns the impact of the type of fat eaten: the effects of physical inactivity may vary according to the length and saturation degree of the fatty acids. We hypothesize that 1) physical activity of moderate intensity, independently of its effect on energy balance, will favor a preferential trafficking towards adipose tissue, will modify the expression of genes implicated in fat oxidation and storage and partly correct the abnormalities observed in obese subjects, 2) effects of physical activity vary according to the saturation degree of fat. Twelve obese subjects, aged 18 to 55, will undergo tests before and after 2 months of training at current recommendations to ascertain dietary fat partitioning using stable isotopes and to determine changes in gene expression with muscle and adipose tissue microbiopsies.",

This and other research concluded that in general, the motility readout of the isovolumetric balloon is associated with gastric contractions.\n\nHowever, the exact relation between individual gastric contractions and individual intraballoon pressure waves remains incompletely understood.\n\nSimultaneous assessment of gastric motility by means of an isovolumetric balloon and dynamic cine-MRI can validate that slow, high-amplitude intraballoon pressure waves are indeed induced by gastric muscle contractions. This evaluation might also enable us to attribute artefacts present in the pressure signal to physiologic processes such as cardiac, respiratory, intestinal and whole-body movements.\n\nTo date substantial uncertainty exists on the optimal procedural approach to evaluate gastric motility simultaneously with cine-MRI and the isovolumetric balloon.\n\nThe aim of this pilot study is to verify the feasibility of a several aspects of a larger confirmatory study protocol.

    "BriefSummary": "Severe sepsis still carries a high mortality rate despite advantages in intensive care medicine and antimicrobial therapy. The inflammatory and procoagulant host response to infection are intricately linked and interactions between platelets, leukocytes and the endothelium play a central role in the pathogenesis of septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Interestingly, one key player cell in coagulation, i.e. the platelet, has been somewhat neglected as to its position in the pathogenesis of coagulation abnormalities in sepsis. However, thienopyridines, irreversible platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor antagonists, e.g. prasugrel, could potentially provide beneficial anticoagulatory and antiinflammatory effects: P2Y12 ADP-receptor antagonists reduce TF-induced coagulation activation in various ex vivo and in vitro models. Moreover, various lines of evidence indicate that thienopyridines may block platelet leukocyte interactions and thereby reduce the propagation of the coagulation and inflammation process.\n\nLPS-infusion in healthy volunteers provides a standardized model to safely study non overt DIC and to document possible effects of therapeutic and prophylactic interventions.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that thienopyridines, irreversible platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor antagonists, may blunt TF-triggered coagulation activation in humans, which will be studied in a TF-dependent coagulation model in humans.",

The challenge is to extract, from few non-invasive sensors on the maternal abdomen, a fetal electrocardiogram (ECGf) of great quality allowing a clinical diagnosis (follow-up of the FHR (fetal heart rate)) and extraction of ECG waveforms).\n\nThe proposed approach proposes a technological breakthrough shared by a consortium of researchers and clinicians. The originality is driven by innovative methodological choices: the use of a multimodal system (ECG coupling with PCG (phonocardiographic)) for the signal acquisition in order to increase the robustness of information extraction, by taking into account clinical uses and the need for the monitoring process support, and by setting up a reference for this multimodal database.\n\nThe objective is to feed a database that will be used in the future to develop ECGf extraction methods estimating the FHR.",

The very attractive prospect of preventing travellers' diarrhea without systemic antibiotics has fueled interest in probiotics for this purpose. However, not all probiotics are identical, and the results of studies conducted with a particular agent cannot be generalized to indicate that any probiotic agent would be successful in the same clinical situation. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus GG have been shown to reduce the incidence of diarrhea in travelers in randomized controlled trials. In contrast, another Lactobacillus preparation, non-viable Lactobacillus acidophilus, showed no benefit over placebo in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of 174 travelers. The reasons for this are unclear, but could be related to the fact that the bacteria were not viable or a peculiarity of the strain selected for testing.",

    "BriefSummary": "Critical illness, severe infection, extensive trauma or tissue damage cause an inflammatory (irritative) reaction in the body. This reaction affects the whole body and causes malaise, circulatory and cardiac changes, fever, increases the number of white blood cells in the blood stream and prompts release of signaling proteins. This reaction contributes to the development of considerable organ damage and possibly organ failure. These are serious complications in critical illness which are associated with a high mortality. This inflammatory reaction is affected by the autonomic nervous system. This is the part of the nervous system, which is beyond the control of the free will, and the part that regulates circulation, breathing and digestive functions. The autonomic nervous system works via so-called sympathetic signals, which set the body in a state of alertness to overcome immediate challenges, and parasympathetic (vagal) signals, which are especially active during restitution and rest. It is known, that the balanced activity in the autonomic nervous system affects the body's inflammatory response in critical illness. A study in mice has shown that if parasympathetic (vagal) signals are blocked mortality in critical illness is increased. Reversely, when the autonomic nervous system is medically stimulated towards parasympathetic signaling, the magnitude of the inflammatory response is decreased. Nicotine exerts this stimulatory effect.\n\nAlso, we know that individuals in good physical shape have increased parasympathetic tone compared to less trained individuals. However, studies have never addressed whether this shifted balance in the autonomic nervous system affects the inflammatory response related to critical illness.\n\nOver the last 30 years an experimental model mimicking the inflammatory response has been used in studies. Inflammation may be simulated by injecting the drug E.Coli LPS, which induces a controlled, fully reversible, harmless reaction the duration of which is a few hours. Influenza-like symptoms occur and changes in circulatory parameters and concentrations of signaling proteins can be measured.\n\nUsing this experimental model, the investigators wish to study whether this shifted balance in the autonomic nervous system in individuals in good physical shape affects the body's reaction to critical illness. Investigators also want to determine how nicotine (using a nicotine patch) affects this reaction.",

Poor accrual to trials has major implications with regards to the pace of progress, the cost of clinical cancer research, and the generalizability of results. The investigators have recently shown in an analysis of 7,776 cancer clinical trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov that approximately 20% of cancer clinical trials fail to complete enrollment at all; the most often cited reason was poor accrual.\n\nPrior research has identified barriers to cancer clinical trial accrual that can be generally categorized in the domains of availability, awareness, and acceptance. Much attention has been paid to the barriers involvement awareness and acceptance - however, trial availability is likely a \"rate limiting step\". This pilot study is the first in a series of planned steps to attempt to shift the current paradigm of \"bringing patients to trials\" to \"bringing trials to patients.\" With the integration of telemedicine visits, the investigators aim to decrease the burden of participation for patients, begin to address geographic barriers, and ultimately improve trial accrual. In this study, men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer (a rising PSA after definitive local therapy) will receive the antidiabetic drug, metformin. Patients will require a single on-site visit for study enrollment.

    "BriefSummary": "One of the biggest challenges of conducting research where the investigators follow people over a long period of time is keeping the participants involved. One of way that investigators may be able to improve participant involvement in research is to give participants the opportunity to complete their questionnaires online.\n\nHere's how the investigators think the Internet data collection system will help to keep participants involved and ultimately help to answer important questions about the effects of nutrition during pregnancy:\n\n1. It will allow investigators to present complicated questionnaires in a way that doesn't confuse participants. For example, instead of telling participants to skip the remainder of a question if they answered no to the first part of the question, the ePRO system does the skipping for them. The result is less confusion, fewer questions to read, and less of the participant's time.\n2. It provides a convenient way for participants to keep track of where to find the questionnaire, and how much they have already completed. Participants sometimes don't have time to answer all of the investigator's questions in one sitting. The ePRO system keeps track of how much participants have already done and it's ready to keep going whenever the participant has time. It also avoids the common problem of losing the questionnaires to the household paperwork pile, or worse to the recycling bin.\n3. It provides timely reminders to participants. Study participants, and especially new moms, are busy and they forget to complete the questionnaires. The ePRO system can provide timely reminders encouraging participants to respond.\n4. It helps participants complete the questionnaires accurately. The ePRO system has an automatic error detection ability that will alert participants to any questions they missed or completed incorrectly.\n\nFinding ways to keep participants involved in research is something that all researchers are concerned about, and ultimately it's a concern for all Canadians because the results of research are often used to make decisions about health care and the kinds of programs that governments provide. Losing any participant from the study reduces the ability of policy makers to take the best decisions and choices about what health services to fund with limited dollars. What the investigators propose is a study to determine whether Internet data entry really will keep participants involved in a longitudinal study. Previous studies have shown that the internet can be a useful tool for getting people to sign up for research and at least one small study showed that using Internet data entry can actually save money. But no researchers have actually tested whether it really does a better job than paper based questionnaires in terms of keeping participants involved.\n\nIn order to answer this question, the investigators will randomly assign the current Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition study participants to either continue receiving the paper-based questionnaire or to start receiving the web-based surveys. The investigators will follow participants over three assessment occasions (over a period of 18 months) and observe any differences between the groups in their involvement. Because the investigators are randomly assigning participants to the two groups, differences in involvement will tell them about usefulness of Internet data entry as a participant retention tool.",

Sodium bicarbonate, as a nutritional supplement, has gained attention over the past decades, because it might delay of offset fatigue. To date, there is a controversial discussion about which delivery mode (amount and frequency) might be best in optimizing endurance performance. Since the high ion load consequent to multiple ingestions might increase plasma volume, and consequently decrease bicarbonate concentrations, single acute ingestion could be more beneficial. However, in multi-day competitions or tournaments it might be necessary to use the supplement on a daily basis. Here, the investigators aim at investigating the effects of single dose or multiple dose (on five consecutive days) administration of bicarbonate vs. placebo increases endurance performance and acid-base homeostasis in trained male endurance athletes.",

However, sex remains a topic that is too sensitive for most people to discuss openly. ED therapies include oral medication, vacuum erection devices, intracavernosal injection, testosterone supplementation, surgery, and psychological counseling. In addition, germanium (Ge), titanium (Ti), and \u03c0 elements are noble metals that can be used to produce far-infrared radiation. There has been little application of these metals to the treatment of ED, but their use is worth investigating. Administered as health textiles, the application of these metals are expected to promote blood circulation, especially in the reproductive system, resulting in an improved sexual performance. Hence, the researcher aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of Ge-Ti-\u03c0 elements fiber textiles as an ED treatment, assessed by using the questionnaires related to the quality of sexual function.",

We designed a cluster randomized stepped wedge trial: The Cambodia Integrated HIV and Drug Prevention Implementation \\[CIPI) study. The CIPI study is embedded within the SMARTgirl HIV prevention program. The CIPI study aimed to recruit FESW from 10 provinces, assessing HIV risk exposures including ATS use. The CIPI study then tested sequentially delivered, behavioral interventions targeting ATS use. The trial combines a 12-week Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) intervention with four-weeks of cognitive-behavioral group aftercare (AC) among FESW who use ATS. The primary goal of the CIPI study is to reduce ATS use and unprotected sex among FESW. The CCT+AC intervention is being implemented in ten provinces where order of delivery was randomized. Outcome assessments (OEs) including biomarkers and self-reported measures of recent sexual and ATS use behaviors are conducted prior to implementation, and at three 6-month intervals after completion. All women who are ATS negative at 6-months, including those who have completed the CCT+AC intervention are eligible to participate in a micro-enterprise (ME) opportunity. Consultation with multiple groups and stakeholders on implementation factors facilitated acceptance and operationalization of the trial. Statistical power and sample size calculations were based on expected changes in ATS use and unprotected sex at the population level as well as within-subjects. Dissemination of process indicators during the multi-year trial is carried out through annual in-country Stakeholder Meetings. Provincial 'Close-Out' forums are held at the conclusion of data collection in each province. When analysis is completed, dissemination meetings will be held in Cambodia with stakeholders, including community-based discussions sessions, policy briefs, and results published and presented in the HIV prevention scientific journals and conferences. CIPI is the first trial of an intervention to reduce ATS use and HIV risk among FESW in Cambodia. Results will inform both CCT+AC implementation in low and middle-income countries and programs designed to reach FESW.",

It is known that dairy products are an excellent source of protein, low glycaemic sugar lactose, calcium, and vitamin D. In our recent study the consumption of a dairy snack with high protein content resulted in reduced blood glucose response compared to non-dairy snack with the similar amount of available carbohydrate. The investigators hypothesize that the ad libitum intake of breakfast cereals served with a high-protein fermented dairy product will result in reduced and sustained blood glucose response compared to non-dairy control. The objective of this study is to investigate how dairy and non-dairy cultured products used as carriers for breakfast granola cereals and consumed ad libitum affect short-term food intake, satiety, and glycaemia within two hours.",

    "BriefSummary": "In the last forty years the prevalence of asthma has increased in westernised countries. We have hypothesised that this increase may be a consequence of changing diet. Several birth cohort studies have now reported an association between reduced maternal vitamin E intake during pregnancy and childhood asthma.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen whether increasing maternal vitamin E intake during pregnancy reduces the risk of childhood asthma. We are planning a large placebo controlled trial in pregnant women, to investigate whether optimisation of dietary vitamin E intake to the recommended 15mg/day reduces the likelihood of childhood asthma. We believe that a dietary intervention using vitamin E in its natural form of food is more likely to be successful and acceptable than a vitamin E supplement. We have previously demonstrated than pregnant women can optimise their vitamin E intake using a personalised dietary plan with the help of a dietitian however this intervention was complex and could not be translated into everyday use. With commercial support we have developed a range of soups containing foods naturally rich in vitamin E designed to optimise maternal vitamin E intake to 15mg/day. A range of similar tasting and looking placebo soups has also been developed. In this study we will pilot a randomised controlled trial of the active and placebo soups to ascertain whether pregnant women are willing and able to optimise their vitamin E intake during pregnancy using the soups in order to reduce the risk of their child developing asthma. optimising maternal vitamin E intake during pregnancy.",

However, transmission still persists and it appears that additional control measures are required. The leading malaria vaccine candidate in development is RTS,S which has efficacy against clinical malaria measured at 30-50% in the field. This partial protection might be enhanced by combination with other components. The other vaccination approach that has produced repeatable efficacy in humans is the use of viral vectors to induce T cell responses. Previous attempts with this vaccine approach have been effective in challenge studies in Oxford, but ineffective in the field, probably because of reduced immunogenicity.\n\nRecently, studies in Oxford, Kenya and the Gambia have shown higher levels of immunogenicity by using a chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd63) followed by an attenuated vaccinia virus (modified vaccinia Ankara) to deliver the pre-erythrocytic antigen, multiple epitope string with thrombospondin- related adhesion protein (ME-TRAP).\n\nThe increase in immunogenicity has lead to sterile protection in 3 out of 14 volunteers and partial protection in 5 out of 14 volunteers in challenge studies.\n\nThe investigators propose a Phase 2b study of 120 healthy adult men in Kenya. The investigators will assess the efficacy and further evaluate the immunogenicity and safety profile of the vaccine regimen.

    "BriefSummary": "We, the researchers at Hamilton Health Sciences, have developed a novel approach to cancer therapy using transfected dendritic cells (DCs) to generate enhanced immunity to defined tumor antigens. Dendritic cells are highly specialized antigen presenting cells found in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, skin and thymus. Infection of DCs with Adenovirus (Ad) vectors incorporating genes for defined tumor antigens enables intracellular expression and major histocompatability complex (MHC)-restricted presentation of tumor peptides by transfected DCs. Given the potent immunostimulatory properties of DCs and ability to use gene transfer to \"load\" DCs with tumor antigen, we hypothesize that administration of transduced autologous DCs may have potential therapeutic benefit as a cancer vaccine. We have examined Ad-tumor antigen DC based vaccination in murine models of breast cancer and melanoma. In both models, injection(s) of Ad-transduced DCs results in highly potent immune activation and antigen-specific anti-tumor responses. In these models, high levels of antigen-specific, cytotoxic effector lymphocytes that recognize and kill cancer cells directly correlates with a therapeutic response (tumor regression and/or complete protection of animals subsequently re-challenged with tumor cells). Animals demonstrating specific in vitro immunity are protected against subsequent injection of cancer cells. Moreover, we have observed complete resolution and significant long-term survival in animals with established metastatic disease with no demonstrable toxicity. As opposed to vaccination protocols with tumor peptides or purified epitopes that are MHC-I restricted (i.e. HLA-A2), we have found that injection of DCs transduced with a vector expressing the entire tumor antigen results in peptide presentation from both MHC-I and MHC-II complexes. The subsequent immune response is comprised of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. Thus, Ad-based gene transfer of tumor antigens appears to be an efficient approach: (1) enabling sustained endogenous peptide processing, and (2) facilitating DC-specific presentation to the host immune system. We have shown that using a replication deficient adenovirus vector expressing Her-2/neu DNA under the control of a human mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter that we can transfect bone marrow derived DCs (AdHer2/DC). These cells are then used to immunize recipient mice against tumour challenge with Her2 transgenic tumour cells. The protection is antigen specific (anti Her2). On the basis of these pre-clinical studies we will initiate a pilot trial of the AdHer2/DC vaccine in Her -2/neu overexpressing patients with metastatic breast cancer. Long-term goals and implications of possible results: The goals of this initial pilot phase I study are to evaluate the safety and dosing schedule of the vaccine therapy. The vaccine will be tested in subsequent phase II and III studies to determine efficacy in comparison to standard therapies. The long-term goals are to eventually test this therapy in the adjuvant breast cancer setting in Her-2/neu overexpressing patients.",

    "BriefSummary": "Many patients with type 2 diabetes exhibit elevated plasma concentrations of the glucose-mobilising pancreatic hormone glucagon; i.e. hyperglucagonaemia. This contributes to the hyperglycaemic state of the patients and is considered an important component in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes; but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. The liver constitutes the main target organ of glucagon, and studies have shown that hyperglucagonaemia goes hand in hand with hyperaminoacidaemia and that both are associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), independently of the presence of type 2 diabetes. In line with this, several recent studies support the existence of a feedback-cycle between the liver and the pancreatic alpha cells, governed by circulating glucagon and amino acids. The investigators hypothesise that the presence of hepatic steatosis results in hepatic glucagon resistance at the level of amino acid turnover, i.e. impaired glucagon-induced suppression of circulating amino acid concentrations. If this hypothesis proves correct, it would establish build-up of fat in the liver as a core mechanism underlying hyperglucagonaemia and, since the hyperglucagonemia is at least partly responsible for the fasting hyperglycaemia, as an important contributor to the hyperglycaemia of type 2 diabetes.",

Paclitaxel dose-dense (weekly) administration renders an improved therapeutic index (activity/toxicity).\n\nThe study is designed to compare 6 courses of FEC scheme (600/90/600), a combination of proven efficacy in node positive breast cancer patients, versus 4 FEC courses followed by 8 weekly paclitaxel administrations (100mg/m2).\n\nThe study hypothesis is that 5-year disease-free survival in the control arm will be 60%. The investigators expect to increase this by 8% with the experimental treatment.

In patents with DOR, the pregnancy rate is about only 2-4%. Eventually, patients with DOR turn to adapt children instead. In recent studies, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS) supplement might play a role in reverse diminished ovarian reserve and improve the prognosis of ART. Cumulus cells, formed cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) with oocyte, play a important role in folliculogenesis, oocyte maturation, oocyte meiosis and ovulation. Growing evidences disclose there are crosstalks between oocyte and cumulus cells as paracrine regulations. Aberration the crosswalks between oocytes and cumulus cells would be associated with poor prognosis of folliculogenesis and further pregnancy outcomes. In patients under ovarian hyper-stimulation protocol, the assessment of cumulus cells might be reliable indicators of folliculogenesis, embryo development, pregnancy rate and pregnancy outcomes. These genes (indicators), such as Hyaluronan synthase\uff08HAS2), Versican (VCAN), Thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), Chromobox homolog 3 (CBX3),Tripartite motif-containing 28 (TRIM28), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2)\uff0cBCL2-associated X protein (BAX).

Research provides evidence that consumption of a diet high in plant foods and rich is polyphenols is associated with a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular disease (Hung et al 2004). Tart Montmorency cherries have been shown to be high in numerous phytochemicals (Wang et al 1999; Seeram et al 2001). Several of these compounds, are known to be vasoactive and improve blood vessel function by increasing bioavailability of vasodilators (Mudnic et al 2012), reducing vasoconstrictors (Broncel et al 2010), decreasing platelet aggregation (Hubbart et al 2006) and increasing blood vessel dilation (Schroeter et al 2006). Impaired function of the lining of blood vessels (endothelial dysfunction) has been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the bioavailability of all the compounds in Tart Montmorency Cherry Juice and their efficacy with respect to vascular function has not been fully determined. This study will examine the influence of tart Montmorency cherry juice on cardiovascular function, specifically arterial stiffness by pulse wave velocity and blood flow in the microcirculation by laser Doppler imaging. This study will also examine digital volume pulse and pulse wave analysis. These data will provide information on the ability of TMCJ to affect blood flow and vascular function.",

    "BriefSummary": "This research aims to determine whether selenium supplements improve bone and muscle health in older women at risk of osteoporosis (low bone density or weak bones) and fracture (broken bones).\n\nOsteoporosis is a major public health problem. One in two women and one in five men over age 50 will have a fracture. Fractures cause pain, disability and reduce life-expectancy. Women with below-average bone density around the time of the menopause might have previously taken hormone replacement (HRT) to prevent osteoporosis, but HRT is much less used now due to side effects. Therefore there is a need for safe, effective and inexpensive preventative interventions for women at risk of osteoporosis.\n\nSelenium is a chemical nutrient present in several human proteins, including anti-oxidants. Anti-oxidants may protect against ageing of tissues, including bone, by mopping up damaging reactive oxygen molecules (sometimes called 'free radicals'). Selenium is present in soil, and so is obtained from many foods. However, soil selenium levels are low in Europe, and dietary intake in the UK is below recommended levels.\n\nWe previously found that women with higher blood selenium levels have stronger bones, but this doesn't prove that giving selenium will improve bone strength.\n\nThe investigators propose a randomised controlled trial to compare selenium supplements with a placebo (dummy treatment) in women with below-average bone density. The investigators will give selenium (at two different doses) or placebo to 120 women for six months and use blood and urine tests and bone density scans to see if giving selenium does have any effect on bone. The investigators will also do muscle function tests and measurements of free radical molecules.",

The TOT procedure is not exempt from complications such as bleeding, bladder injuries and pain in the thigh/groin. In addition it is commonly performed under general or regional anesthesia1-3. The single-incision mini-slings (SIMS) were developed to reduce the risk of complications by avoiding the blind passage of the trocars through the obturator space. In addition, the use of SIMS could enable surgeons to perform the procedure truly under local anesthesia.\n\nDifferent devices for SIMS procedure are available. However, the evidence about their efficacy is controversial4-7. The main limitation of these devices could be the predetermined length of the mesh and the weakness on its fixation. The design of the SIMS Ajust\u00ae allows adjusting the length of the sling to each individual woman and provides a robust fixation into the obturator membrane. Recent prospective studies on the efficacy and safety of the sling Ajust\u00ae have obtained promising results8,9. Even so, the NICE guidelines advise to use SIMS in the context of research studies10.\n\nThe objective of this study is to establish if the effectiveness of the SIMS Ajust\u00ae is non-inferior to that of a standard TOT, as well as to compare the comorbidity of both procedures. Owing to the new appearance and fast evolution of these procedures, randomized comparative studies with SIMS are required in order to determine its place in the treatment of SUI.",

To achieve this goal, digital platforms, which are the latest technological developments are used. However, studies using digital platforms on smoking cessation and postpartum smoking relapse in pregnant women are limited in this area. The research was carried out to determine the effect of smoking cessation intervention prepared in line with the transtheoretic model on the digital platform, on preventing smoking relapse in the postpartum period. As a result of the research, it is thought that nurses will guide their professional practices with an evidence-based up-to-date approach.",

Moreover, women may acquire NNRTI resistance from primary transmission, or use of nevirapine (NVP) in previous pregnancies. In these circumstances, DTG is likely to be more effective in reducing mother to child transmission of HIV than NNRTI-based regimens.\n\nStudy design: HIV positive pregnant women presenting with untreated HIV infection in late (\u226528 -36 weeks gestation) pregnancy will be randomised 1:1 to receive DTG (50mg once daily) or standard of care (nevirapine or efavirenz) + 2 NRTIs. PK (0-24h) profile will be sampled in third trimester and post-partum.\n\nAlthough this is primarily a PK study (and has been powered as such) randomisation is included to allow comparison of plasma HIV VL responses against standard of care (NVP or EFV) and is essential for evaluation of secondary endpoints of safety and efficacy of DTG in pregnancy.\n\nNumber recruited N=30 per group",

The two groups received the corresponding doses of esketamine intravenously, followed by an intravenous injection of propofol (injection time was 30 s). The initial dose of propofol was 2 mg/kg, and the dose ratio of propofol in the adjacent patients was 0.9. If there was a positive reaction to LMA insertion, the dose ratio in the next patient was increased by one gradient, and if not, the dose ratio was decreased by one gradient. The median effective dose (ED50), 95% effective dose (ED95) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) of propofol for inhibiting a response to LMA insertion in the two esketamine groups were calculated using a probit analysis.",

Three quarters of these infants are born between 34 0/7 and 36 6\u20447 weeks' gestation or late-preterm (LP). Mothers of LP infants are at increased risk for postpartum stress, depression and mother-infant interaction problems posing significant risks for infant development. Our proposed project will advance the fields of maternal and child health by examining the impact of the Newborn Behavioral Observations Family Wellness (NBO-FW), a dyadic, two generational intervention targeting maternal wellbeing and early mother-infant relations in families of LP born infants. The NBO-FW is a 12week preventative intervention aimed at promoting maternal mental health and positive parenting. It is based on the highly successful NBO intervention developed by our team and applied across five continents, but with important new elements targeting maternal mental health and the needs of high-risk LP infants and their families. Participants will consist of 200 first-time mothers and their LP infants (100 intervention and 100 control dyads) born at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), an urban teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School and the largest maternity care provider in Boston. Data will be collected at three time points: during the birth hospitalization, at a follow-up visit at 4-6 weeks corrected gestational age, and at a further visit 10-12 weeks after birth. Outcomes will include standardized measures of maternal stress, depression, parenting confidence, and observed mother-infant interaction. Information about infant health care practices and maternal/infant health will also be recorded. We hypothesize that, compared to mothers in the care as usual control group, first-time mothers of LP infants who receive the NBO-FW will demonstrate a) lower levels of stress and depression, b) greater parenting confidence, c) higher quality interactions with their infants (e.g., positive affect, sensitivity, responsiveness, emotional connection); and (d) engage in more optimal infant health care practices.",

    "BriefSummary": "There is a strong correlation between major adverse health consequences of obesity and development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is characterized by abnormal hepatic accumulation of triglycerides and other lipids. It has become a worldwide health problem that accelerates cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and especially premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.\n\nThe plasma level of glutathione (GSH) is typically depleted in individuals with metabolism related disorders. However, cellular GSH levels cannot be increased by supplementing GSH and it must be synthesized within the liver either de novo or by salvation pathway. The level of GSH is not enough to maintain and regulate the thiol redox status of the liver in subjects with high hepatic steatosis at fasting stage due to the depletion of glycine. Glycine can be synthesized via the interconversion of serine. It has been shown that the serine synthesis is downregulated in patients with NAFLD and supplementation of serine has attenuated alcoholic fatty liver by enhancing homocysteine metabolism in mice and rats. Depleted liver glutathione is also restored by the administration of N-acetylcystein as in acetaminophen poising. L-carnitine and nicotinamide that both stimulate the transfer of fatty acids from cytosol to mitochondria have been identified as two additional cofactors that are depleted in patients with NAFLD.\n\nIn this study, the kinetics in blood of pivotal metabolic cofactors, serine, L-carnitine, N-acetylcystein and nicotinamide after single and simultaneous dietary supplementation, are measured.",

Nutritional loading during exercise may prevent and and/or reduce some of these troubles.\n\nIn regard of recent data, we proposed a novel energy drink (NUTRAPERF\u00ae) to limit deleterious effects of long time exercise in neutral environment (outside temperature between 4 and 25\u00b0C) and to improve performance. If performance may be increased by this energy drink during long time exercise, we proposed that it consumption may also improve performance in short and sub-maximal exercise.\n\nSo, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the consumption of this novel energy drink on performance during long and short time exercise. Moreover, we studied the effects of this consumption on different metabolic parameters (heart rate, oxygen consumption, respiratory quotient, ventilation, glycemia, lactatemia), on central and peripheral fatigue and on cognitive parameters.",

The effectiveness of the different nutritional regimes, which differ in their carbohydrate content, will be investigated not only by functional tests but also the measurement of the mechanistic processes in the muscle will be explored.\n\nMagnetic resonance (MR), better known as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has been widely used in clinical practice as a non-invasive imaging technique. Importantly, in addition to producing anatomical images, an MR scanner also offers the possibility to measure the concentrations of a number of metabolic products. This is done through a technique known as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).\n\nThis research project asks the following questions:\n\n* Can a diet containing carbohydrates with a low glycemic index achieve the same adaptations in basic endurance/fat metabolism as a high fat, low carbohydrate (ketogenic) diet?\n* Does a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, compared with a high-carbohydrate diet, prevent improvements in performance in the submaximal and maximal range?\n* What is the effect of diets with different carbohydrate content and variable glycemic index on endurance performance in a half marathon and a time trial?\n* How do the diets with different carbohydrate content and variable glycaemic index affect the energy and glycogen stores in the muscles?\n\nIn active recreational athletes, the objectives are: (1) to investigate the effects of different diets with variable carbohydrate content and glycaemic index on substrate metabolism, (2) to determine the effects of the different diets on energy stores using multinuclear dynamic magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and (3) to measure the effects of the different diets on endurance performance.",

Despite the urgent need for effective prevention approaches for AAMSMW, to our knowledge no evidence-based HIV interventions have been developed and tested for this population. This study is a randomized controlled trial of the Bruthas Project(BP), an individual-level HIV prevention intervention, which builds on standardized HIV counseling and testing. Delivered in a series of four sessions by trained African American male counselors, the BP focuses on reviewing HIV transmission routes for male and female partners, strengthening sexual communication skills with both male and female partners, and improving condom use skills and other safer sex negotiation strategies. A randomized controlled trial of BP is necessary to determine the efficacy of the intervention and can lead to improved public health efforts at reducing HIV risk behavior among AAMSMW and in the African American community more generally. To evaluate the effect of the BP, the investigators will recruit and enroll a cohort of 400 AAMSMW who will be randomly assigned to either the intervention condition, in which they will be offered BP, or to the comparison condition, in which they will receive standardized HIV testing and counseling with referral to case management.

    "BriefSummary": "Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men in the Western world. Early detection of prostate cancer has been shown to decrease mortality, but has limitations with low specificity leading to unnecessary biopsies and over-diagnosis of low-risk cancers. The STHLM3 trial has paved the way for improved specificity in early detection of prostate cancer using the blood-based STHLM3 test for identifying men at increased risk of harbouring significant prostate cancer.\n\nTargeted prostate biopsies based on MRI images have been shown to increase sensitivity of high-grade cancers compared to the currently used systematic biopsies, but existing evidence are contradictory and not free from methodological flaws.\n\nThe primary aim of STHLM3-MR/Fusion is to increase the specificity in early detection of prostate cancer without decreasing the sensitivity of aggressive prostate cancers by introducing targeted prostate biopsies and comparing to traditional prostate biopsies. The primary endpoints are the number of performed biopsies and the number of detected high-grade prostate cancers defined as Gleason 7 or higher. Secondary endpoints include the number of low risk prostate cancers diagnosed and the proportion of patients with up-or downgraded disease after assessment of prostatectomy specimen. Additional aims include to assess the health economic consequences of implementing MRI based prostate cancer diagnostics and to improve the quality and effectiveness of prostate cancer diagnosis in the routine health care in Stockholm.\n\nThe STHLM3-MR/Fusion project will be performed in two separate phases, analyzed separately. Based on power calculations, approximately 500 planned for prostate biopsies will be included in the first phase. Men who have previously been diagnosed with prostate cancer may not take part in the study. The study period of Phase 1 is March 2016 to January 2017. The second phase will start in autumn 2016 and end by December 2017.",

    "BriefSummary": "The investigators' research group is working to develop a highly effective, low cost non-surgical method of permanent contraception for women. To support this goal, we need to know more about the normal fallopian tube (tube that passes the egg from the ovary into the womb). The purpose of this study is to learn about how menstrual cycles and hormonal contraceptives affect tubal patency. Normally there is an opening between the tube and uterus to permit the flow of fluid and cells. If this opening is blocked, this can result in infertility. Tubal patency is when a woman's fallopian tubes are not blocked. Tubal patency is determined by an x-ray test called a hystero-(uterus)salpingo-(fallopian tube)graphy (HSG). HSG is a standard radiological imaging study that is used to determine if the fallopian tubes are open and free of disease. It is commonly done in women with an infertility diagnosis. The investigators usually do this test in the first 10 days of the menstrual cycle. Sometimes the tubes will appear to be blocked on the HSG when they are actually open. The timing of the HSG study during the menstrual cycle, or the use of hormonal contraception may make a difference in whether the tubes appear blocked on the HSG when they are actually patent.\n\nThe results of the HSG test provide a good model for how our nonsurgical permanent contraception method might work. The investigators think that if the tubes are not patent, that our treatment will not work as well. Therefore, in this study we want to learn if menstrual cycle timing or current hormonal contraception use will affect the patency of the tubes as assessed by the HSG. The investigators want to examine the same women to see if tubal patency is changes during the menstrual cycle and during the use of a birth control pill and the birth control shot.",

Methyl groups are usually added or removed as needed and can be influenced by diet soon, dietary factors have been linked to the change of DNA methylation, resulting in changes in gene expression. Research on the prevalence of gene methylation levels on the impact of nutrient intake, as well as the inflammatory condition and the results of dietary interventions for the genes, it is a sparse area in studies and, therefore, expanding of the knowledge. Thus, understanding the effects of a diet rich in antioxidants and hazelnut oil, in inflammation and DNA methylation profile is important because chronic diseases with cardiovascular disease can begin with the consumption of modified lipids and can research this stage provide important dietary allowances for the development of this disease prevention strategies even in adulthood.

If Omega-3 fatty acids used in this study are shown to reduce myofacial pain then this formulation could potentially be used for treatment of TMD patents with myofacial pain in the future. Omega-3 fatty acids are natural ingredients with almost no side effects. Topical application can lead to fewer side effects than systemic medications. In addition, there is no substantial morbidity \\& mortality associated with topical application of Omega-3 fatty acids. It is hypothesized that subjects receiving topical application of omega-3 fatty acids will demonstrate reduced subjective masseter muscle pain in comparison to subjects receiving placebo cream. This is a pilot study to assess the topical application of Omega-3 fatty acids on muscle pain in the muscles of mastication.",

    "BriefSummary": "The original concept of a quadratus lumborum block (QLB) indicated for analgesia after abdominal surgery was first described by Blanco in 2007. Also referred to as a posterior transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block, the QLB consists in deposition of local anesthetic on either the posterior or the anterolateral border of the quadratus lumborum muscle. TAP blocks have already been proved effective in urologic, abdominal, and gynecologic procedures by blocking the sensory nerve supply to the anterior abdominal wall thus reducing the amount of postoperative analgesic medication. The main advantages of QLB compared to the TAP block is a wider sensory block area and a longer duration of analgesia. This is due to the extension of local anesthetic agents beyond the TAP plane to the thoracic paravertebral space(4).\n\nPrevious reports have shown that QLB is effective in providing pain relief after various abdominal operations. However, there are no published reports on QLB for postoperative pain after abdominoplasty. This prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled study aims to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, opioids consumption and quality of recovery of QLB in patients undergoing abdominoplasty. Patients scheduled to have abdominoplasty will be randomized to receive bilateral QLB with either ropivacaine 0.2% or normal saline. Post-operative cumulative analgesic medication consumption, pain severity at rest and on movement, as well as quality of recovery will be evaluated and compared in both groups.",

It is also predicted that young men who receive the CAMI-TPP will report higher completion of a reproductive health service visit with sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing over the course of study participation compared to those in the CAMI-Fitness (CAMI aimed at healthy diet, physical activity and tobacco avoidance) group.",

Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of cervical cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bevacizumab together with radiation therapy and cisplatin may kill more tumor cells.",

The current study is an extension on two studies already preregistered (NCT04209283 and NCT04342416) that included some aspects of in-person recruitment and/or intervention delivery (rather than fully remote as we aim for here). The intervention is a simple cognitive task (a memory cue followed by playing the computer game \"Tetris\") with accompanying information. A within-subjects multiple baseline AB design is used, in that the length of baseline ('A'; no intervention) and intervention ('B') phases vary within-subjects across individual intrusive trauma memories. Participants will aim to complete at least one week of the baseline ('A') phase followed by at least two intervention sessions with a researcher remotely (via telephone or secure video platform). Intervention sessions comprise the simple cognitive task alongside accompanying information presented in the form of brief animated videos (e.g., explaining the target symptom). Participants are instructed that they may continue using the technique self-guided in subsequent weeks, and they may opt for additional intervention sessions with remote researcher support (maximum 6 intervention sessions). Participants will be asked to monitor the occurrence of intrusive memories of trauma in a daily diary. It is predicted that participants will report fewer total intrusive memories in the fifth week after the second intervention session (primary outcome) compared to in the first baseline week. The investigators will also explore whether the frequency of targeted intrusive memories is going to decrease relative to non-targeted intrusive memories. Furthermore, the investigators will explore whether having fewer intrusive memories is related to functioning and/or PTSD, depressive or anxiety symptoms.",

Estimates indicate that in low resource settings, CS comprises up to 50% of more of the total volume of operations performed. The World Health Organization recommends national CS rates of between 10-15% to save lives and improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. Population-based work indicates that CS rates of up to 19% are demonstrably related to improved maternal and neonatal survival. However, complications are common, and gynecological and obstetric surgical interventions are associated with high rates of morbidity. In low resource settings, complication rates are particularly high.\n\nThe intervention being tested is based on a previously developed program called Clean Cut. Clean Cut is an adaptive, multimodal surgical infection prevention program that integrates perioperative process improvement and patient outcomes measurement using process mapping, training and improved management practices, and compliance with critical standards of surgical antisepsis. It was successfully piloted in five surgical departments in Ethiopia, and reduced the relative risk of infection by 35%. This has been adapted specifically for obstetric and gynecological operations and will be evaluated in a cluster randomized stepped wedge trial design in ten maternity hospitals/departments in Ethiopia in order to reduce infections and other complications for women undergoing cesarean delivery and other obstetric and gynecologic operations.",

    "BriefSummary": "Approximately 75% of cancer survivors experience some degree of cognitive deficit throughout their cancer experience, with upwards of one third of breast cancer survivors reporting impairments up to a decade after treatment. Chemotherapy and adjuvant therapy to remove cancerous tissue can result in deficits in attention, speed of processing, memory, and quality of life. Physical activity has been associated with a number of health benefits for breast cancer survivors including improvements in cognitive function. The investigators recently reported on the beneficial effects of acute exercise, or single sessions of physical activity, on processing speed and spatial working memory in breast cancer survivors, suggesting that acute bouts of physical activity may mitigate select domains of CRCI. Specifically, survivors in this study demonstrated faster processing speed, and trended towards faster and more accurate spatial working memory, after thirty minutes of moderate-intensity walking compared to seated rest. But half an hour of walking may be challenging to certain subgroups of survivors, particularly those who are deconditioned or with significant barriers to longer walks. With a renewed focus on un-bouted physical activity and avoiding inactivity during survivorship, it is important to better understand the dose or volume of exercise responsible for providing breast cancer survivors with the greatest cognitive benefits. The investigators examined the effects of varying durations of exercise (e.g., 10, 20 and 30 minutes) on cognitive function in breast cancer survivors to identify the optimal length of acute exercise. Findings from this study will inform new guidelines for acute exercise after cancer.",

    "BriefSummary": "Aging is characterized by functional losses among which, the related to mobility and balance may be highlighted. Regular physical activity, including muscle strengthening exercises, is beneficial to a healthy elderly. Thus, this study aimed to verify the influence of 8 weeks-program of lower limbs strengthening exercises in the balance and functional mobility of physically active elderly. The investigators evaluated 18 women, with ages between 61 and 80 years. Balance assessment was performed using the Functional Reach Test (FRT), Timed Up and Go (TUG) test and Romberg test in stable or unstable soil. For muscular strengthening of the lower limbs, the workload was determined by the strength reached in the eight-repetition maximum test (8RM), applying progressive load increments between training sessions conducted (50% , 60% , 70% of 8RM), with the muscle strength being reevaluated in the fourth week of training, with subsequent adjustment of the load for the subsequent training. The training took place in two weekly meetings, in 40-minute sessions, during eight weeks. Data were analyzed using the paired-t test and ANOVA with repeated measures. Among 18 evaluated elderly women, 7 completed the 8 week training proposed. Decrease in TUG time (p = 0,035) and statistically significant increase in muscle strength were observed in all muscle groups trained (quadriceps, hamstrings, adductors and abductors). FRT (p = 0.170) was not significantly different after training. Therefore, strength training proposed was efficient in improving muscle strength in the lower limbs of irregular physically active elderly, impacting positively on functional gain gait. However, the gain in muscle strength was not enough to generate significant results in static balance probably due to the type of exercise performed as well as due being limited to muscle groups of the lower limbs.",

The addition of information gained by use of intraoperative laser-assisted fluorescent angiography (measured with the Spy Elite imaging device) will reduce complication rates by directing intraoperative resection of ischemic tissue and limiting the volume of immediate implant placement in instances where real time imaging would suggest compromised perfusion.

There is not only no census on the definition of CE, the current literature on the impact of CE on reproductive outcome is controversial and consists only of retrospective studies with small sample sizes. Although there is a presumption that CE is related to poor IVF outcome, this belief has not been proven.\n\nDesign: Prospective cohort study\n\nSetting: Infertility clinics of 2 academic medical centers\n\nPatients: Patients between the ages of \u2265 21 and \u2264 35 years old undergoing their first IVF cycle will be invited to participate.\n\nMain Outcome Measures: The primary outcome will be ongoing pregnancy after 12 weeks estimated gestational age (EGA) with previously documented fetal cardiac motion. Secondary outcomes will include pregnancy loss rate as defined by chemical pregnancy, blighted ovum or loss of fetal cardiac motion before 12 weeks EGA.\n\nMaterials and Methods: The cycle prior to IVF, patients will undergo an in-office endometrial biopsy on cycle days 19-24. Samples will be stained for CD138 and the number of plasma cells will be quantified. The number of plasma cells in a sample that yields the best sensitivity and specificity for pregnancy will be determined by a Receiver-Operator-Curve. This number will then be used as a dichotomous variable to assign categories of \"positive for CE\" and \"negative for CE.\" Pregnancy and miscarriage rates will then be determined in the positive and negative CE sample with Chi Square Analysis. A secondary sub analysis will be performed to determine pregnancy and miscarriage rates in patients who declined to participate in the study.\n\nExpected Results: The investigators hypothesize that higher rates of CE will be found in women failing to conceive with IVF and with subsequent first-trimester miscarriage.",

    "BriefSummary": "Methamphetamine (MA) is a psychostimulant drug with high abuse potential. MA can be smoked, snorted, injected or ingested orally to produce a release of high levels of dopamine into the brain and reduction of dopamine uptake. Its use results in feelings of pleasure, increased energy, and greater alertness lasting up to 12 hours. In 2010, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that 353,000 Americans aged 12 or older reported being current MA users. Over the past decade MA use rates have fluctuated with current use rates on the decline; however, importantly, even though overall use rates are declining, use rates among males and females are approaching equal proportions. This use rate pattern is unlike other drugs of abuse, which typically demonstrate males using more than females. In some states, more females than males consider MA as their drug of choice. Namely, in a 2010 report in the state of Utah, more females were diagnosed with MA as a primary substance of abuse than males upon admission to treatment.\n\nDepression and MA use are highly comorbid. The relationship between MA use and depression is likely bidirectional, with MA use causing changes in mood and being used as a self-medicating behavior to reduce symptoms of depression. Several studies have shown that depression rates are higher in MA-using females compared to their male counterparts. It is likely that neurobiological and psychosocial mechanisms contribute to increased incidence of depressive symptoms in females.\n\nNo clear treatment model exists to suggest how the comorbidity of depression and MA use is best managed. In studies of antidepressants for treatment of MA withdrawal and dependence, findings have suggested that antidepressants are ineffective for treating depressive symptoms.\n\nCreatine is an organic acid occurring naturally in vertebrates, where it takes part in energy homeostasis in tissues with fluctuating energy demands. Exogenous creatine has been shown to increase brain concentrations of PCr. Neuroimaging studies of creatine have shown increased brain phosphocreatine (PCr) content with creatine administration. Therefore, we hypothesize that oral creatine administration will increase PCr levels and reduce depressive symptoms in a sample of depressed female MA users. This hypothesis will be tested by a within subjects design by giving depressed MA using females oral creatine for eight weeks and measuring PCr pre- and post-treatment with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Moreover, depressive symptoms will be measured by administration of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale twice weekly during the course of creatine treatment.",

    "BriefSummary": "In Phase I of this R34, the team from the University of California Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Irvine researchers plan to utilize the successful community participatory approaches to refine a gender-sensitive criminogenic needs -focused intervention program, Female Ex-Offender Mentoring in Care (FEM-CARE), with the help of a community advisory board, composed of homeless female offenders (HFOs) and addiction staff; and finalize strategies which will be validated by focus group sessions with the HFOs. In Phase 2, the research team will randomize 130 HFOs participating in one of two residential drug treatment programs to assess the impact of the FEM-CARE or a Health Promotion control program on reduction of drug and alcohol use and recidivism. This study is based upon our team's history of promoting theoretically-based, culturally sensitive nurse-led interventions that are enriched with criminal justice theoretical perspectives, and have resulted in significant reductions in drug and alcohol use among homeless persons, many of whom have had a history of incarceration.\n\nSpecifically, the study aims are:\n\nAIM 1) Guided by a Community Advisory Board (CAB) made up of HFOs and addiction staff, further conceptualize our community-based program, Female Ex-Offender Mentoring in Care (FEM-CARE), to address the needs and risks of HFOs enrolled in RDT programs, and then refine the program in focus group discussions with 12 HFOs.\n\nAIM 2) Conduct a pilot RCT to assess the impact of the FEM-CARE program for 65 HFOs at six-month follow-up compared with 65 HFOs receiving a control Health Promotion (HP) program, in terms of a) self-reported and/or objective measures of drug and alcohol use; and b) prevalence of recidivism and number of days to first reincarceration.\n\nHypothesis 2a: HFOs in the FEM-CARE program will have less drug and alcohol use at six months than HFOs in the HP control program.\n\nHypothesis 2b: FEM-CARE HFOs will have a lower prevalence of recidivism by six months and greater number of days to first reincarceration than HP control HFOs.",

    "BriefSummary": "Men who have sex with men (MSM) bear a disproportionate burden of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic in Canada, and HIV incidence appears to be rising among Canadian MSM (1). MSM comprised nearly half (44.1%) of new positive HIV tests in 2009 (2). Among MSM in Ontario, from 2001 to 2006, HIV diagnoses increased 26% (3). Given the alarmingly high HIV prevalence rates among MSM in North American cities, there is a critical need for HIV prevention interventions for MSM in Canada. Social anxiety, or anxiety about being evaluated in interpersonal situations, is a reliable risk factor for unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) among MSM (4 and 5). Social anxiety is highly modifiable via cognitive-behavioural therapy, a form of psychotherapy (6). Social anxiety may also increase substance use in sexual situations, which is another risk factor for HIV among MSM (7 and 8). As such, an empirically-based social anxiety treatment may also reduce HIV risk behaviours among MSM. The present study will provide Phase I trial data for a novel and innovative HIV prevention intervention for MSM. This is a proposal to test a novel integrated HIV prevention intervention that combines empirically supported treatments for social anxiety with HIV risk reduction counseling to reduce HIV sexual risk behaviour.",

Low BMD may reflect osteoporosis, a condition where there is an increased risk of fracture. Women who have gone through menopause have a higher risk of getting osteoporosis because they lose calcium from their bones much faster than younger women. Women with breast cancer may have an additional risk for getting osteoporosis because of the effects of their treatment with chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to see what levels of BMD post-menopausal women with breast cancer have, and to see if the level of BMD changes during a women's treatment after her surgery. This trial studies changes in BMD and markers of bone activity in women receiving treatment for early stage breast cancer.",

The disease is activated by genetic and environmental factors, yet the female gender is the strongest risk factor. The sex hormone estrogen has been proven in the past to be an enhancer of the immune response. Estrogen serves as a ligand for two specific receptor proteins. Lab studies that we have already done have shown estrogen significantly increases these two ligands in the T cells from SLE females, but not in T cells from normal women. These estrogen-dependent increases are blocked by the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780. The objective of this research is to investigate if ICI 182,780 alters disease progression and/or activity in females with SLE and may provide a new treatment for women with SLE. This is based on previous work we have done.",

The molecular links and metabolic shifts driving this association remain open to debate, but notably, reduced muscle mitochondrial fatty acid (FA) \u00df-oxidation is more prevalent among insulin-resistant/diabetic persons. Therefore, discovery of biomarkers reflective of the status of an individual's muscle FA \u00df-oxidation activity or capacity would have tremendous prognostic and diagnostic value in terms of diabetes. Furthermore, characterization of metabolites associated with muscle mitochondrial fat metabolism should uncover candidate signaling factors which tie FA \u00df-oxidation to insulin signaling. The investigators propose to identify, for the first time, specific biomarkers of muscle FA \u00df-oxidation using multiple metabolomic analytical platforms to compare metabolite profiles in samples derived from biological systems displaying disparate muscle fat combustion. The current experiment will test whether plasma metabolites and/or metabolite signatures that track efficient muscular FA \u00df-oxidation can be experimentally increased in obese, insulin-resistant subjects via a diet-exercise regimen designed to improve muscle fitness and FA combustion.",

The experimental group will be prescribed 20 oxycodone-acetaminophen and the control group will be prescribed 28 oxycodone-acetaminophen at the time of discharge. Both groups will also be provided with a handout on non-opioid analgesia. The groups will be assigned randomly in blocks. The investigators will recruit patients either in the clinic, if participants are to have a scheduled cesarean section, or at some time during the hospital admission for delivery. The satisfaction survey and pain scale will be administered at the postoperative check by the clinic staff and providers. These surveys will be stored in a secure location at the clinic. If the patient does not show up for their postoperative visit, 3 attempts total will be made by an investigator to reach the patient and administer both surveys by phone within 2 weeks of discharge. A preliminary analysis of the data will be done once half the study patients have been recruited. The investigators do not foresee any threats to the external or internal validity of the study. The investigators are taking many measures to limit study bias. First, block randomization will help limit discrepancies between groups. Also, strict adherence to the inclusion and exclusion criteria will also help limit confounders that may make data difficult to interpret, such as non-opioid na\u00efve patients and complications that may potentially increase pain and opioid requirements. Lastly, blinding of patients to the number of pills participants receive will help mitigate patient bias.",

    "BriefSummary": "Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by the occurrence of abnormally frequent episodes of interrupted ventilation (apnea) or significant reduction of ventilation (hypopnea) during sleep. It is linked to a repeated collapse of the upper airways during sleep.\n\nEpisodes of apnea and hypopnea cause hypoxemia and micro-awakenings with a well-established impact on quality of life and daily activities. Physiologically, OSAHS can be aggravated when moving from a standing to a supine position through fluid shift from the lower limbs to the upper body, thereby modifying the opening of the upper airways. A decrease of the water balance by bilateral diurnal compression of the lower limbs (during daytime in standing position) may limit this nocturnal fluid shift (at night in supine position) and thus reduce the severity of OSAHS.\n\nTwo comparative clinical trials \\[Redolfi 2011; White 2015\\] have shown a clinically modest reduction of sleep apnea (-36% and -27%, respectively), which was however statistically significant versus untreated control group (p = 0.002 and p = 0.04, respectively), when elastic compression medical devices of 20 to 30 mmHg were worn during the daytime. The hypothesis of fluid shift influence on OSAHS has been tested \\[Berg 1993; Redolfi 2011; White 2015\\], but the decrease of the water balance when the device is used remains to be quantified.\n\nThe CVE101-15 exploratory clinical investigation sponsored by Laboratoires Innothera performed on healthy volunteers confirmed the hypothesis of a diuretic effect of elastic compression stockings applying a pressure of 33 mmHg at the ankle, worn for 13-14 hours during the daytime for 3 days, with a good safety profile of this device. Moreover, it enabled the identification of reliable parameters and the endpoints to be used to demonstrate a diuretic effect.\n\nBased on this information, there may be a real interest in conducting further investigations about the evolution of water balance beyond a 3-day period of elastic compression use in the daytime.\n\nHence, the main objective of this clinical investigation is to compare precisely, under standardized test conditions, water balance changes in healthy subjects over 5 days with or without daytime use of the investigational medical device (IMD), an elastic compression device prototype specially designed for this study.",

Bangladesh having one of the highest incidence rate (21.6%) in the world.The short-term consequences of LBW is 12 times higher perinatal mortality. It is estimated that LBW causes 60 to 80 % of neonatal deaths. For the survivors, the effects are long lasting and largely irreversible. Infants born LBW are at 2-4 times greater risk to develop acute diarrhea, pneumonia or acute respiratory tract infection than their normal birth weight counterparts. Adults born with LBW suffer increased risk of high blood pressure, coronary heart disease (CHD), non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, obstructive lung diseases, or renal damage.\n\nGenitourinary (GU) infection, as a major risk factor for low birth weight deliveries affecting a very large number of women both in the industrialized and the developing world. In Bangladesh, there was a high incidence of UTI in 21-25 years age group (44.61%). The bottom line for GU infection is that lactobacilli, healthy bacteria lose their dominant. Recently, the protective role of the commensal microbiota has come into focus for its infection-inhibiting function. Lactobacilli that colonize the gastrointestinal tract or vagina can either significantly modulate the colonic microbiota by increasing the number of specific prebiotic bacteria such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria or reducing undesired intestinal colonization of pathogenic bacteria. Prebiotic like Fructooligosaccharide (FOS) is known to promote growth of normal healthy flora like lactobacilli (LAB). FOS supplementation in early pregnancy improves vaginal or gut microflora with LAB , which will control GU infection and improve pregnancy outcome and promote infant's growth and development",

PSMA is a well characterized histological marker of prostate cancer tumor aggressiveness but a quantitative non-invasive method for PSMA detection and monitoring is not currently available. Development of such an imaging biomarker would be useful to differentiate indolent from aggressive prostate cancer phenotypes and allow for selection of appropriate risk adaptive therapies. The investigators preliminary first-in-human studies demonstrate high specific DCFBC uptake in metastatic prostate cancer and feasibility for prostate cancer imaging. The investigators propose to study patients initially diagnosed with biopsy-positive prostate cancer to determine if DCFBC uptake and location by PET imaging will be positively correlated with prostate cancer by prostatectomy tissue step-section analysis. DCFBC uptake at sites of suspected metastatic disease will be compared to conventional imaging modalities (CT, bone scan) and biopsy results when available. In addition, DCFBC-PET uptake quantification will be compared with expression levels of PSMA and other prostate cancer relevant markers (PSA, Ki-67, TMPRSS2-ERG) by prostate tissue immunohistochemistry analysis and compared with clinical prognostic markers (PSA, Gleason score, clinical stage, Partin tables derived prediction of pathologic stage).",

Some recent studies have shown that obese people present modifications of colon microflora and a low-grade inflammation.\n\nIn our laboratory, we have demonstrated that the intake of fructans lessens dietary intake, body weight gain, adipose tissue accumulation and steatosis in rodents. These effects lead to an improvement of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in diabetic rats and mice. Fructans are also able to restore the microflora disturbed by a high fat diet and to prevent endotoxemia. Moreover, studies have shown that fructans intake promotes satiety (Cani et al, Diabetes 2007) and or decreases fat mass (Abrams et al, Journal of Pediatrics 2007) in healthy human. An intervention study in obese patients is thus needed to study the effects of fructans in the target population.",

    "BriefSummary": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major health concern amongst Veterans as it causes poor health, lost days at work, impaired psychosocial functioning, and decreased quality of life. Current treatment options for AUD show limited effectiveness, which is exemplified by high relapse rates. Chronic heavy drinking results in psychological and physical distress during abstinence, including anxiety, irritability, and general discomfort, which increases the urge to drink to relieve these symptoms. The hypothesis of this study is that noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS) can modify the perception of such inner bodily sensations of distress, and consequently reduces the drive to drink for relief. The aim of this study is to establish feasibility and acceptability of applying nVNS as a rehabilitative treatment for AUD in Veterans. The study will also evaluate the effect of nVNS on functional outcomes, quality of life, distress, and craving, and if nVNS alters neural activation patterns in brain regions involved in the perception and awareness of distress and pain.",

    "BriefSummary": "Regular physical activity (PA) contributes to reduced risk of obesity, chronic disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, and can improve emotional and mental health, learning, productivity, and social skills. Latina girls are less likely to meet guidelines for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) than non-Hispanic white girls; factors that contribute to low PA rates among Latina girls include sex role expectations, low PA competency, few active role models, lack of parental support for PA, and lack of access to resources.\n\nThe goal of this study, informed by social cognitive theory and family systems theory, is to design, implement, and evaluate an intervention promoting physical activity among Latina pre-adolescent girls (aged 8-11) and their mothers. The intervention is based on evidence suggesting that parent-child interventions and single-sex interventions are more effective at improving PA. Mothers and daughters will participate in a 12-week virtual intervention where they will engage in weekly 1.5-hour sessions that incorporate didactic teaching, skill-building, interactive discussions, and PA. Each session will include at least 30 minutes of PA. The intervention will be compared with a control condition that will receive an abbreviated version of the intervention following completion of all measurement points.\n\nNinety mother-daughter dyads will be randomly assigned to the intervention or the wait-list control condition. The primary aim is to determine whether the intervention will increase MVPA among Latina girls in the intervention condition relative to those in the control condition. The investigators hypothesize that daughters participating in Conmigo will have higher minutes of MVPA at M2 and M3 compared to girls in the delayed treatment control condition.",

All patients will be managed by a standard propofol-remifentanil based total intravenous anesthesia protocol. The incidence and intensity of shoulder pain at rest and with motion will be evaluated by an independent doctor blinding to medication and grouping using visual analog scale (VAS) at 6h, 24h and 48h postoperatively. Other types of pain (e.g. trocar wound and visceral pain), side effects (such as postoperative nausea and vomiting, itching, dizziness, and oversedation) will be assessed as well. At the end of the observation, the intensity of the maximum pain will be recorded, and the effect of shoulder pain on the four variables regarding to quality of life (activity, mood, walking and sleep) will be assessed using modified Brief Pain Inventory(BPI) questionnaire.",

    "BriefSummary": "With sensitive urine pregnancy tests, women are now able to confirm very early pregnancies. However, approximately one third of abortion facilities do not offer abortions at less than six weeks of pregnancy. Providers may be concerned that they will be unable to identify products of conception (POCs) in uterine aspirates after early abortion and about the time, cost and risk associated with following serum hCG levels when completed abortion cannot be confirmed by gross inspection. Many providers believe that manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) causes less destruction of pregnancy tissue and therefore may increase the likelihood of identifying POCs on gross inspection. No published reports specifically compare MVA to electric vacuum aspiration (EVA) for the detection of complete products of conception and none compare MVA and EVA at less than 6 weeks of pregnancy. We, the investigators, propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing the sensitivity of MVA to EVA for the detection of completed abortion in 500 women with pregnancies of less than 6 weeks gestation at a large inner city family planning center. We will measure positive identification of POCs on gross inspection in patients subsequently shown to have completed abortions. We hypothesize that the rate of true positive detection of POCs will be higher in dilation and curettage (D\\&C) using MVA than EVA.",

Patients' preferences for cancer screening are known to significantly influence utilization, and thus impact health outcomes. In a recent study the investigators conducted at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, the investigators observed that among women age 50-75 years admitted to general medicine services over 4-month period, 40% were non-adherent to breast cancer screening (overdue) despite being insured.\n\nTherefore, the investigators propose to establish a cohort of hospitalized women to help the investigators develop successful interventions for enhancing breast cancer screening utilization in this group. In following a cohort prospectively, the investigators intend to both reaffirm the results from the investigators' previous study and determine whether the patterns of mammographic screening improve over time as a result of the investigators' interventions. Among non-adherent (overdue) women, the investigators will educate and encourage these women to undergo outpatient screening mammography.\n\nTo more comprehensively assess the preventive health in this cohort, the investigators will assess the cohort's adherence to colon cancer screening recommendation and barriers to colon cancer screening.\n\nIn addition the investigators will also like to encourage the hospitalists and house staff taking care of these patients to perform oral cancer screen among women who smoke (non-adherent to breast cancer screening) Finally the investigators will also like to ask the perspective of cancer screening among these women.",

To this end, we propose to evaluate an innovative cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation intervention for low-income, minority women conducted in the prenatal and postpartum phases. Considering the strong link between tobacco use and cancer risk, the development of effective smoking cessation treatments has important health implications for cancer prevention and control initiatives. The aims to be addressed are:\n\nAim 1: To compare an enhanced Cognitive-Behavioral Counseling (CBC) smoking cessation intervention with a Best Practice control condition (BP) for reducing smoking rates (i.e., continued abstinence, 7-day point prevalence, and number of cigarettes smoked) in the short- and long-term among pregnant women. It is hypothesized that smokers receiving CBC will show reduced rates of tobacco use, versus those in the BP, over time.\n\nAim 2: To evaluate the impact of the CBC intervention on the hypothesized mediators of behavior change (i.e., heightened risk perceptions; enhanced self-efficacy and reduced fatalistic beliefs; high pros and low cons of quitting; reduced emotional distress). It is hypothesized that the psychosocial factors will mediate the effect of the CBC intervention on change of smoking behaviors.",

The trial compared the effects of a differential intervention with a protocol focused on an ankle neuromuscular training program vs the usual FIFA 11+ program, in order to strengthen functional ankle stability in youth soccer in male players. In each subject, 2 measurements were taken: Pre-intervention and Post-intervention. For each measurement, a hypothesis test was performed.\n\nResults: The FIFA11+ is expressed as an injury risk factor when buying it with the PENMT after their participation.\n\nConclusion:The neuromuscular training program for the ankle or PENMT applied in the experimental group did not generate a negative effect with respect to the FIFA 11+ program, in addition to the time of departure in the post test, the PENMT program is expressed as a protection factor of player injuries when contrasted with the FIFA 11+ program, that is, it presents effectiveness against the risk factor of functional ankle instability.",

Retrospective studies have shown that artificial shrinkage of the blastocoelic cavity (also called collapse) and dehydration of the blastocyst just before vitrification can have a positive effect on the survival after warming. This collapse can be induced by using a laser. The study of Iwayama et al. 2010 has shown a similar survival rate but an increase in the implantation rate of collapsed blastocysts compared to non-collapsed blastocysts.\n\nThe aim of the study is to investigate the effect of artificial shrinkage by laser-induced collapse on the implantation potential of vitrified-warmed day 5 or day 6 blastocyst stage embryos in a prospective randomised controlled trial.",

    "PrimaryCompletionDate": "2022-06-21",
    "BriefSummary": "Preeclampsia is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. The morbidity and mortality of this condition arises from two main causes: 1) the lack of specific and sensible methods for its diagnosis and prognosis, 2) and the fact that the course of the disease is often unpredictability at its presentation and speed of progression. The majority of deaths are undoubtedly avoidable and are due to a substandard care. Nowadays it's known that preeclampsia is a placental disorder that is characterized by an unbalance of angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors. It has been recently proven that the ratio of sFlt-1 to PlGF in women who presented with a clinical suspicion of preeclampsia is useful distinguishing between women in whom preeclampsia would develop and those in whom it would not. A low ratio also predicted the absence of fetal adverse outcomes in the same time frame. In addition this ratio demonstrated to be useful to discriminate among patients that would developed maternal or fetal adverse outcome. Correct identification and diagnosis of women at risk could potentially prevent all these adverse outcomes thus, clinical experience suggests that early detection and monitoring are beneficial.\n\nEuroPE aims to provide evidence that the re-definition of pre-eclampsia as an entity caused by a placental unbalance of angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors and its incorporation in the diagnosis and classification of the disease would improve maternal and neonatal health.\n\nThis will be an open, multicentre, international, randomised controlled trial with an intention-to -treat analysis. The study is pragmatic: it will be undertaken to reflect real clinical practice rather than the very tightly controlled circumstances of explanatory trials. The main objective of this study is to determine the effects of the use of the ratio as a diagnostic tool in the definition and classification of PE, as compared with its usual definition, in triage and delivery decisions and to see whether this new approach is able to improve maternal and perinatal outcomes.",

    "BriefSummary": "This study will examine the benefits of weight loss alone or in combination with a GLP1 receptor agonist, liraglutide, on beta cell function in young adult Mexican American (MA) women with prediabetes. The Investigators have chosen to focus on MA women because MA women are at very high risk for progression to diabetes and have not traditionally been involved in weight management studies since they are thought to be difficult to recruit and retain in such programs. However, investigators have had particular success in working with young MA women using specifically developed ethnic and gender conscious programs. Because weight loss does not prevent all progression to diabetes, some participants will receive the diabetes medication, liraglutide, which has been shown to stabilize beta cell function. The study will also interrogate for polymorphisms of known T2DM genes to correlate with beta cell response to weight loss and liraglutide treatment. Additionally, this investigation targets serious health disparities in metabolic disease in a highly vulnerable, rapidly growing population, testing novel gender and culturally focused intervention strategies and identifying genetic biomarkers of response to a pharmacologic intervention that targets the pancreatic \u00dfcell.\n\nThese results will help to a) understand mechanisms of disease, b) personalize treatment through identification of a high risk group that may be amenable to specific therapy, and c) ultimately, sets the stage for an intervention trial to prevent diabetes, a major chronic and costly disease, in Mexican Americans.",

Several types of HPV infection are transmitted by sexual activity and, in women, can infect the cervix (part of the uterus or womb). This infection often goes away by itself, but if it does not go away (this is called persistent infection), it can lead in women over a long period of time to cancer of the cervix. If a woman is not infected by HPV, it is very unlikely that she will get cervical cancer. This is an observer blind follow up study of the study HPV-001, which evaluated the ability of the HPV vaccine to prevent HPV infection. The current study invites all of the 1113 subjects in the HPV-001 study that received all three doses of vaccine/placebo to be enrolled and followed-up for several additional years to see if the HPV vaccine prevents HPV-16 and HPV-18 infections and to evaluate the safety of the vaccine.

GH (in concert with lack of insulin) induces lipolysis during fasting. It is not known how GH exerts its lipolytic actions.\n\nThe aim is to define insulin and growth hormone (GH) signalling pathways in 3 different states in patients with DM I.\n\nAnd to test whether ATGL-related lipolysis in adipose tissue contributes to the development of ketosis.\n\n1.

For the majority of the patients, symptom and distress can be reduced if adequate treatment is provided. This study aims to test possible differences between the impact of standardized care and the WOMAN-PRO II program on symptom prevalence in women with vulvar neoplasia after surgical treatment.\n\nIn a sequential explanatory mixed-methods project, a randomized phase II study will be followed by a qualitative sub-study. Ninety patients with vulvar neoplasia treated surgically will participate in the randomized trial in four Swiss hospitals and one Austrian hospital. After stratification by precancer/cancer, women will be randomly assigned (1:2 ratio) to standardized care and the WOMAN-PRO II program. The standardized care group will receive a set of information leaflets about supportive care options in the clinic. The WOMAN-PRO II program group will obtain counseling sessions by specially trained gynecology-oncology nurse specialists at the moment of diagnosis, 7 days post-surgery, in week two after discharge, week twelve and week 24 after surgery. The primary outcome of this study is symptom prevalence. Secondary outcomes will be collected for explorative reasons and include symptom distress, uncertainty, quality of life, social support, resilience, quality of care, sociodemographic and medical characteristics, post-surgical complications, functional status, cost evaluation and process outcomes. Quantitative data will be collected at the counseling points of time and analyzed by using mixed linear regression analysis. Twenty interviews will be conducted with women of the WOMAN-PRO II program group. A focus-group interview will be conducted with twelve gynecology-oncology nurse specialists in order to better understand to which degree the interventions meet individual needs as well as to identify remaining barriers and enablers for the implementation of symptom self-management. Qualitative data will be analyzed by using thematic analysis and a critical hermeneutic reflection.\n\nThis study will evaluate the impact of the WOMAN-PRO II program on symptom prevalence, patient-reported outcomes and clinical parameters, and inform the design of a possible phase III study on the clinical efficacy of the program.",

We hypothesize significantly improved outcomes in the intervention group compared to the control group at post-treatment and at all follow-ups. The pilot will use a quasi-randomized design, with participants assigned to alternating treatment and control blocks. Analyses will be conducted using intent to treat and per protocol methods. Following group assignment, all women will be scheduled for a baseline interview at a time convenient for the participant. Participant interviews will take approximately 1.5 hours. Mothers will be compensated with a gift card in the amount of 40 USD for each interview. In addition to the core evaluation metrics, mothers' demographic information will be obtained (age, relationship status, employment, education, number of children, income). Following the baseline interview, the PMEP will be provided to the treatment group; participants will receive 2-hours of contact time per week for 5 weeks (2-hour sessions, held once weekly). Women will receive reminder calls the day of each session to identify and resolve any barriers to attendance (e.g., transportation). Taxi fare will be supported for women who are unable to obtain transportation if the bus is not feasible. Following the completion of the PMEP groups or - for the control group - after 5-6 weeks has passed, all participants will complete a second interview. This interview will include all of the core measures of hypothesized treatment change, thereby permitting a comparison between women in the treatment and control groups over time. All women will be invited in a third time when their infant is 3 months old and again when their infant is 1 year of age to evaluate parenting and infant outcomes. Women will participate in a brief phone assessment when their children are between 3.5 and 5 years of age that includes all primary study outcomes.",

The mechanism by which berberine exerts a protective role in atherosclerosis is unclear. Protoberberines have been identified as a new inhibitor of AKR1C3, an enzyme responsible for the regulation of steroid hormone action.3 The investigators propose to examine the effects of berberine on a set of well-established CVD risk factors including lipids, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, coagulation factors, adiposity, fasting glucose, insulin, and liver function, as well as to examine potential mediation via testosterone and/or sex hormone binding globulin using a mechanistic, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Chinese men with hyperlipidemia.",

Prolonging chemotherapy until disease progression, however, must be weighed against the detrimental effects of continuous chemotherapy delivery. The SNAP trial seeks to improve the tolerability of prolonged chemotherapy administration strategy by studying alternative treatment schedules, while preserving and possibly improving treatment efficacy in this disease setting.\n\nThe availability of a new nanoparticle albumin-bound taxane, nab-Paclitaxel (Abraxane\u00ae), represents an opportunity to test this hypothesis. Nab-Paclitaxel has been developed in an attempt to reduce the toxicity associated with standard taxane administration (caused by the use of chemical solvents) while increasing antitumor efficacy.\n\nThe SNAP randomized phase II trial evaluates three schedules of nab-Paclitaxel as prolonged chemotherapy administration strategy. Each of three arms will be compared to a historical reference of seven-month median progression-free survival (PFS) based on the most recent trial with docetaxel as control arm to determine whether any of the three arms are worthy of further investigation.",

The transversus thoracic muscle plane block (TTP) block is a newly developed regional anesthesia technique which provides analgesia to the anterior chest wall. First described by Ueshima et al. in 2015, the TTP block is a single-shot nerve block that deposits local anesthetic in the transversus thoracic muscle plane between the internal intercostal and transversus thoracic muscles. TTP block targets the anterior branches of the intercostal nerves (T2-6).\n\nPectoral plane blocks are recently described . PECS block involves deposition of local anesthetic drug between muscle planes. PECS I block, between Pectoralis Major and Minor at third rib level, and PECS II block, the drug is deposited between Pectoralis minor and Serratus anterior muscle.\n\nThe pectoral nerves (PECS) block provides analgesia of the lateral mammary region, the intercostobrachial and lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves (T2-T6), the medial cutaneous nerve of the arm and forearm, and the long thoracic and thoracodorsal nerves. The modified PECS block produces excellent analgesia and can be used to provide balanced anesthesia.",

    "BriefSummary": "Transgender women (trans women; assigned male sex at birth but identify as female) are at high risk for HIV infection, and are an important, under-researched population in sub-Saharan Africa. Trans women have a 13 times greater risk of acquiring HIV than adults aged 15-49 years in the general population, and in Africa, trans women have nearly twice the HIV prevalence (25%) of men who have sex with men \\[MSM\\] (14%). Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective prevention tool that could change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic among the 25 million trans women globally, yet its use has been suboptimal in this vulnerable population. Same-day PrEP initiation is feasible and acceptable and improves retention in PrEP care in resource-rich settings. Same-day initiation of emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (F/TAF), a new PrEP regimen, has not to our knowledge previously been evaluated as PrEP in African trans women. F/TAF is potentially more efficacious and safer than emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (F/TDF) as shown in the recent DISCOVER trial. However, concerns about drug-drug interactions between feminizing hormonal therapy (FHT) and PrEP are a key potential adherence barrier for trans women. While PrEP drugs do not lower FHT levels, FHT decreases plasma TFV and (emtricitabine) FTC levels. Little is known about FHT use among African trans women taking F/TAF or how concerns about F/TAF-FHT interactions may influence PrEP adherence. Moreover, interventions to support PrEP adherence in this population are needed. Feedback about PrEP use has been shown to potentially improve PrEP adherence among MSM but has not been utilized among trans women. Key knowledge gaps include: 1) whether same-day PrEP can be successfully implemented for African trans women, 2) the impact of drug-level feedback on PrEP adherence, and 3) how use of FHT may influence PrEP adherence.\n\nTo address these questions, this protocol describes a randomized trial to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of same day initiation of F/TAF PrEP, evaluate impact of drug-level feedback on PrEP adherence and characterize PrEP persistence, and in-depth interviews to explore how self-care interventions for sexual health influence prevention choices among trans women and their sexual partners. This will be the first clinical trial, to our knowledge, to evaluate F/TAF as PrEP for HIV-negative trans women in sub-Saharan Africa.",

A variety of methods have been used for testing the sensory block such as cold, light touch, sharp touch or prick and transcutaneous electrical stimulation. In addition to the diversity of methods, the endpoints used by investigators have also been variable, considering total or partial responses as endpoints. Not surprisingly, a variable sensory block level could be identified as a result of the different methods and types of question asked by the examiner. Another complicating factor is the lack of standardization of the direction of the testing as it relates to anesthetized and non-anesthetized areas. This lack of standardization may result in a difference of several dermatomes in the level that two different assessors might record for the same patient. Considering a clinical research scenario, it may be difficult to replicate results and implement clinical practices. The objective of this study is to determine the degree of agreement between two methods of assessing the sensory block level to cold in women receiving epidural analgesia for labor (anesthetized to non-anesthetized segments versus non-anesthetized to anesthetized segments).",

Physical activity is related to a lower risk of adverse cardiovascular consequences, involving heart failure. The purpose of the study: determine the effect of different types of aerobic training on peak VO2 and ejection fraction in diastolic heart failure patients. Subject and methods: Forty eligible male patients with diastolic heart failure, aged between 50 - 60 years old, participated in this study. They were selected from an outpatient clinic of general Zagazig hospital and were assigned into 2 equal groups in numbers. The first group (A) received aerobic exercise for the upper limb in form of arm ergometer exercises, while the second group (B) received aerobic exercise for the lower limb in form of cycling. Training duration for both groups was 3 sessions/week for 12 weeks. Peak VO2, and ejection fraction of both groups were measured and compared pre and post-treatment. Results: There was no significant difference in the ejection fraction between groups post-treatment. There was a significant increase in the peak VO2 of group B compared with that of group A post-treatment. Conclusion: there is no effect of different types of aerobic training on ejection fraction and peak VO2 for diastolic heart failure patients, but lower limb exercise is more effective than upper limb exercise in improvement of peak VO2 for diastolic heart failure patients.",

In these previous works we have begun to develop techniques to obtain Magnetic Resonance (MR) biological images and co-register tissue in prostate cancer patients.\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n\n-The primary objective of the first portion of this study is to assess the feasibility of using Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to treat the at-risk lymph nodes in prostate cancer. Also, if feasible, we hope optimize this technique with experience.\n\nELIGIBILITY:\n\n-This is a study of image guided, targeted radiation therapy in patients with high risk of nodal metastases from prostate cancer. Patients with prostate cancer who have more than 15% risk of lymph node (as defined by the Partin tables) metastasis will be eligible for this study.\n\nDESIGN:\n\n* On the first 10 patients, we will perform approximately 5 computed tomography (CT) simulations throughout the course of their therapy. On each simulation, the initial treatment plan will be re-run. The dose-volume data from target and normal tissues will then be re-analyzed. From this analysis we will be better able to determine the size of margins needed to account for organ motion and changes such as varying amounts of gas in the bowel and fluid in the bladder. To the best of our knowledge, no such analyses have been published.\n* If the initial part of this trial is feasible, we will proceed to a phase I dose escalation trial of radiation to the at-risk lymph nodes. The primary statistical objective of the phase I portion of this study is to estimate the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of external beam radiation based on evaluating acute toxicity. The study will be conducted with a dose-escalation design with 3 patients in each dose cohort. If fewer than 2 of 3 patients experience an acute dose limiting toxicity (DLT) than patients will be accrued to the next dose cohort. If 2 or more of 3 patients experience a DLT then the MTD will be exceeded and the prior, lower dose cohort will be considered the MTD. Secondary objectives of this study are to relate patterns in gene and protein expression to response and toxicity and to evaluate the frequency of late term toxicity.\n* Specific procedures and risks will be described in a separate consent to be obtained at the time of biopsy. Tissue samples will be processed for complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) microarray testing and stored for future analysis in the Radiation Oncology Branch, NCI.\n* Anatomic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance (MR) biological images of the prostate and pelvis will be obtained and tissue will be acquired with biopsy locations precisely translated (co-registered) to an MR image of reference. A fiducial marker (gold seed) will be left at the biopsy site as a fiducial marker to direct future radiation therapy to the prostate. If necessary, additional fiducial markers will be placed for prostate localization during treatment.",

Since the French paradox was reported, a number of experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated the protective effect of red wine compared to other alcoholic drinks on different pathways of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The investigator's previous results revealed that wine contain micro-constituents that exert potent in vitro anti-platelet and anti-inflammatory actions. Also, the wine consumption along with a standardized meal reduced platelet aggregation and biosynthesis of Platelet Activating Factor in healthy men.\n\nAlthough a large number of studies have reported protective effect of wine against atherosclerosis in healthy people there are few data about the effect of long-term moderate wine consumption in population with CVD. Therefore, the aim of this randomized, intervention clinical study, with control group was to report the effects of regular light to moderate wine consumption on cardiovascular biomarkers in people with CVD.",

Progressive exercise, in which exercise is started at low levels and then increased, is one of the most reliable treatments, but people with FMS often avoid exercise or stop after completing exercise programs. This research will focus on the idea that people with FMS do not exercise because they are afraid of injury or have had a negative experience exercising. Participants will undergo one or a combination of several different treatments that aim to reduce fear of exercising. The different treatments will then be evaluated on their effectiveness in reducing disability among people with FMS.",

    "BriefSummary": "The amount and kind of food which is ingested influences the regulation of meal size. Neural signals from the gastrointestinal tract travel via the vagus nerve to the brainstem and thalamus, which projects to the rest of the brain, in particular the hypothalamus, amygdala and primary sensory cortices. In neuroimaging studies in which the stomach was distended with a gastric balloon activation was observed in the right insula, left posterior amygdala, left posterior insula, left inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex. So far, no study has examined the effects of the ingestion or infusion of a food on the brain. In addition to neural signals, hormonal signals are important for meal termination. Hormones like insulin, ghrelin and cholecystokinin interact with gastric as well as sensory signals in the process of satiation, which ultimately leads to meal termination. The aim of this study is to investigate the interaction between food administration, hormone responses and brain responses. To this end an oral or intra-gastric load will be administered while measuring brain activity (functional magnetic resonance imaging) and hormone concentrations. Subjects will participate in one trainings session and in three functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions (35-min fMRI scan). A training session will take 40-minutes and consists of placing a naso-gastric tube and ingesting 500 ml of chocolate milk orally. The fMRI sessions will consist of three conditions: in condition one (A) 500ml of chocolate milk will be administrated orally.

    "BriefSummary": "Anemia is still a main public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa. Anemic women have an increased maternal and perinatal mortality and anemic adults have diminished work capacity. In sub-Saharan Africa, the etiology of anemia is multifactoral; the major causes are low dietary bioavailability and chronic parasitic infections such as malaria. These causes are likely to interact because infection and infection-associated inflammation may impair the utilization and absorption of iron. Therefore, the control of parasite infections may be important to improve iron bioavailability from foods.\n\nMalaria infections are endemic in northern Benin. To investigate the contribution of asymptomatic malaria (a positive blood smear for malarial parasites but without clinical symptoms of fever, headache or malaise) to anemia, we are planning a human iron absorption study in Benin. We will recruit adults with asymptomatic malaria infection. The iron absorption and utilization of the study subjects will be studied while infected, then they will be treated to clear their infections, and then iron absorption and utilization will be restudied. Iron absorption will be determined by incorporation of labeled iron into erythrocytes, 14 days after the administration of a test meal containing labeled iron (stable isotope technique). Subjects will be men and non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding women with a body weight \\< 65 kg and between the age of 18 - 30 years.\n\nThe results of this study will provide important information on the influence of malaria infections on iron absorption and utilization in humans. The study will provide insight into the potential necessity of malaria control to ensure iron bioavailability from foods in developing countries.",

Injecting the local anesthetic ropivacaine into this space will block these nerves and prevent pain following c-section. The investigators will compare two different approaches to injecting the local anesthetic in this space. Conventionally, the block is done after surgery is completed and the abdomen is closed. The anesthesiologist introduces a needle through the abdominal wall skin under ultrasound guidance to reach the TAP space and the drug is injected. Since the TAP layer is one of the deeper layers of the abdominal (belly) wall and is closer to the inside of the abdomen than to the outside (skin), injecting from the inner aspect of the abdominal wall during the surgery is easier and quicker to perform than the conventional block and does not require ultrasound guidance as there is no risk of injury to abdominal organs like the liver.\n\nWith this research the investigators attempt to prove that surgically administered TAP blocks take 25% less time to perform compared to the conventionally administered TAP block for post cesarean section pain relief. Surgical TAP blocks are also more cost-effective as in addition to reduced OR time, they are safer and do not require skilled operator and specialized equipment. Secondary outcomes will include total time spent in the Operating room, presence and severity of postoperative pain, time to first request for pain medication, total postoperative narcotic consumption in 48 hours after surgery and side effects.",

Given that PCOS is a frequent condition and weight loss is essential but difficult to achieve, it is important to study if the effect on body weight reported in other studies can be confirmed in a selected population of hyperandrogenic patients, especially with medications currently approved for weight reduction. High dose liraglutide alone results in significant weight reduction in obese women without PCOS. There is limited data on weight loss with high dose liraglutide in non-diabetic females with PCOS treated with this agent . Studies on the effect of anti-obesity medication combined with lifestyle changes on body weight and composition and androgen excess in obese women diagnosed with PCOS are lacking. The investigators aim to elucidate the most efficacious weight reduction regime in obese PCOS women. The investigators further hope to determine which treatment(s) addressing the multifaceted disturbances of this disorder in patients with PCOS and obesity emerges as the preferable therapy.",

Studies propose the use of partial vascular occlusion (OVP) of the quadriceps muscle to increase muscle strength and endurance, without joint overload or discomfort to the patient. However, there is no consensus on the use in individuals with PFPS. Objective: To establish the effect of quadriceps muscle strengthening with OVP and low resistance to exercise on pain, functionality, postural control and muscle recruitment in women with patellofemoral dysfunction. Methods: Women with PFPS (n = 20) will respond to pain and functionality scales. The postural control and muscle recruitment of the quadriceps will also be evaluated in dynamic activities of single-legged squat and up / down stairs using a force platform and surface electromyography. After the initial assessment, the participants will be randomized into two groups: conventional quadriceps strengthening with greater resistance loads to exercise and quadriceps strengthening with OVP and low loads. And they will perform a six-week treatment protocol with exercises to strengthen the quadriceps. At the end of the intervention protocols, all of them will be reassessed immediately, after four and eight weeks. Expected Results: It is expected that the group submitted to exercises with OVP and lower load will present the same results of postural control and muscle recruitment compared to the conventional strengthening group. These results will indicate the possibility of using exercises and loads with less joint impairment.",

    "BriefSummary": "Rationale:\n\nThe hysteroscopic morcellator (HM) is a novel technique for removal of intrauterine polyps, myomas and placental tissue. It withholds some technical advantages over resectoscopy. Previous data suggest that it's a faster technique than the latter, and shows that it has a low complication rate.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo compare the HM to bipolar resectoscopy for removal of:\n\n1) large intrauterine polyps, 2) smaller type 0 and 1 myomas, 3) residual placental tissue, in terms of efficiency and complications.\n\nStudy design: Single blind, randomized controlled multicenter trial.\n\nStudy population: Women aged over 18 years old with:\n\n1) large (\u2265 1 cm) intrauterine polyps, 2) smaller (\u2264 3 cm) type 0 or 1 myomas, 3) residual placental tissue, who are planned for hysteroscopic removal.\n\nIntervention:\n\nPatients are randomized between removal with the HM or the bipolar resectoscope.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints:\n\nInstallation and operating time.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness:\n\nWomen who are referred to our polyclinic will be seen on a first visit, and, according to the standard work-up, an ultrasound will be performed when intrauterine pathology is suspected. To confirm the diagnosis a saline infusion sonography (SIS) and/or ambulant diagnostic hysteroscopy will be performed consequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed and surgery is planned, women will be asked whether they want to take part in this study. At this moment, both techniques are used in our hospitals and the choice of treatment depends on the preference of the gynaecologist. All women will be treated with operative hysteroscopy in a daycare setting according to the standard of care, only now randomized between the two techniques. A standard postoperative visit with ultrasound examination and/or ambulant diagnostic hysteroscopy is scheduled 6 weeks later. Late postoperative complications and complaints are recorded.\n\nIt is expected that the HM beholds some advantages over the bipolar resectoscope such as shorter operating time and less complications (e.g. risk of perforation, current and fluid related complications). Previous data do not demonstrate any additional risks related to the use of the HM. Moreover we will check whether the HM has a lower risk of intrauterine adhesion formation, as this might influence patient's fertility.\n\nAfter completion of the RCT, an observational study is planned considering pregnancies subsequent to the hysteroscopic procedure.",

    "BriefSummary": "Mastectomy triggers stress and inflammation responses due to tissue trauma. Surgical stress will increase levels of hormones (adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, antidiuretic hormone, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) and inflammatory cytokines (Tumor Necrotic Factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1, interleukin-2, and interleukin-6) in the body. This causes insulin resistance, gluconeogenesis, and glycolysis, and impaired insulin secretion, which results in hyperglycemia due to intraoperative stress. Intraoperative hyperglycemia increases postoperative complications and mortality. Inhibition of hyperglycemia due to operative stress and stress hormones with good anesthetic management in improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe choice of opioid type plays an important role in suppressing the perioperative stress and inflammatory response. Opioids are an alternative, besides the use of regional anesthetic techniques which have been proven to suppress the perioperative stress response. Fentanyl is one of the phenylpiperidine synthetic opioids. Large doses of fentanyl can reduce stress responses but also increase side effects, such as hemodynamic instability and decrease T-cell function.\n\nRemifentanil provides unique pharmacokinetic benefits through nonspecific esterase enzyme metabolism, so it has a very fast onset and half-life. In addition, remifentanil also provides benefits in reducing the production of interleukin 6 cytokines (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and inhibits neutrophil migration through the endothelial layer.\n\nThe stress response to stress and inflammation is directly proportional to the dose of remifentanil given. It is reported that remifentanil can suppress cortisol response according to increasing dose.\n\nWinterhalter et al. and Lee et al. reported that remifentanil is better at suppressing the stress response than fentanyl. On the other hand, Bell et al. showed no difference in cortisol and hemodynamic levels between the two groups.\n\nThe goal of this study is to see if remifentanil provides less increase in serum epinephrine level, norepinephrine level, platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR), and blood glucose level at one-hour and 24-hours postoperative in patients undergoing mastectomy surgery under general anesthesia.",

    "BriefSummary": "5-10% of breast cancer patients carry a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. Genetic counseling and DNA testing are usually offered to selected patients after primary treatment has been completed (e.g. the first year after diagnosis). For women with a mutation in one of the two breast-ovarian cancer syndrome genes, chances of a second breast cancer are high, and therefore a proportion of these women may opt for preventive measures in addition to their immediate breast cancer treatment. Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy significantly reduces this risk, and is associated with a reduction in mortality.\n\nGenetic counseling and testing for breast cancer typically takes approximately 4-6 months to complete. However, some hospitals and laboratories are now able to generate test results within 3 to 6 weeks. This technology of rapid genetic testing creates new opportunities for providing both women and their treating surgeons with information potentially relevant for deciding between available treatment options, including type of surgery and adjuvant therapy.\n\nThe study will focus on newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who, prior to receiving treatment, are identified as having at least a 10% risk of carrying a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.\n\nWe will investigate whether women with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer make use of rapid genetic counseling when offered.\n\nFurthermore, we will investigate whether the process of genetic counseling (and subsequent DNA testing) has influence on the choice of treatment, and whether and how such rapid genetic counseling and testing (RGCT) affects levels of risk perception, cancer-related worries and distress, and decisional satisfaction.",

    "BriefSummary": "Breast cancer (BC) is a major health problem and the most prevalent cancer among women.In a substantial proportion of familial cases, germ-line mutations in either BRCA1/2 can be detected. The only proven modality for active risk reduction (rather than passive early detection), is prophylactic surgery - prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy. While the majority of Jewish mutation carriers elect to undergo prophylactic oophorectomy at about age 40 years, in Israel only a minority perform prophylactic mastectomy. Another ramification of being a mutation carrier is the emotional stress associated with that discovery.Genetic information has profound implications for mutation carriers. The IBSR (Inquiry-based stress reduction) intervention, developed by Byron Katie, trains participants to reduce their perceived level of stress by self-inquiry of their thoughts and beliefs connected to stressful circumstances or symptoms. This meditative process, named \"The Work\", enables the participants to identify and question the stressful thoughts that cause their suffering. The core of IBSR is simply four questions and a turnaround, which is a way of experiencing the opposite of what the participant believes. This process is simple, powerful and provides skills for self-inquiry and management of stressful thoughts that can be easily implemented in daily life \\[ \\]. Therefore, on the basis of previous data and beneficial observations we postulate that the clinical utility of IBSR mediation program may improve psychological and physical symptoms and quality of life among asymptomatic (oncologically healthy) BRCA1/ BRCA2 mutation carriers. Thus, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to scientifically investigate the effect of this intervention effects on BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.",

What drives this urge to drink is the thirst mechanism. Following ingestion of fluids, there is an inhibition of thirst before there is a replenishing of fluids. However, there is little scientific evidence of where thirst is inhibited, if this thirst inhibition is augmented by exercise and how thirst itself influence exercise performance. Further, during rehydration studies, it is very difficult to successfully blind a subject to their drinking/hydration protocol. Previous studies that have blinded a subject to their drinking have used various methods such as intravenous fluid administration and/or nasogastric tubes. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to examine the mechanistic roles thirst inhibition plays while exercising in the heat while undergoing intravenous fluid administration. Specific attention will be directed to the cardiovascular and thermoregulatory function of the individuals.

    "BriefSummary": "Rationale: The progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass with aging, or sarcopenia, has a major impact on our health care system due to increased morbidity and greater need for hospitalization and/or institutionalization. One way to prevent skeletal muscle loss is to improve dietary intake of the elderly. Both whey and casein seem to offer an anabolic advantage over soy protein for promoting muscle hypertrophy. As a consequence it is assumed that (all) plant based proteins have less potent anabolic properties when compared with animal based proteins. However, there is little theoretical background for such assumptions.\n\nObjective: To provide evidence for the efficacy of wheat protein and wheat protein hydrolysate when compared with milk proteins (i.e. whey and casein) as a dietary protein to stimulate postprandial muscle protein synthesis in vivo in healthy older humans.\n\nStudy design: double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study Study population: 60 healthy non-obese (BMI 18.5-30 kg/m2) older males (age: 65-80 y) Intervention: A protein beverage (350 mL) containing 30 g of whey, casein, wheat protein, or wheat protein hydrolysate or 60 g of wheat protein hydrolysate will be consumed (n=12 per group).\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: Primary study parameters include muscle protein synthesis rates. Secondary study parameters include whole-body protein synthesis, breakdown, oxidation, and net balance.\n\nHypotheses: We hypothesize that ingestion of wheat protein hydrolysate results in a greater muscle protein synthetic response when compared with the intact wheat protein due to its faster digestion and absorption. Furthermore, ingestion of wheat protein hydrolysate results in a higher muscle protein synthetic response when compared with casein, but lower when compared with whey protein. Ingestion of 60 g of wheat protein hydrolysate (amount of leucine equal to 30 g of whey protein) will result in a similar muscle protein synthetic response compared to ingestion of 30 g of whey protein.",

In the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and CVD, inflammatory processes play a pivotal role. In a previous intervention study (11 weeks), however, we found no effects of lower-GI vs. higher-GI diets on fasting inflammatory markers in subjects with increased risk of developing the metabolic syndrome. People, however, spent most of their time in the postprandial period. Therefore, there is a need to study the postprandial effects of low-GI vs. high-GI diets. In addition, it needs to be emphasized the GI is derived from studies in lean subjects, while especially overweight and obese people suffer from metabolic aberrations related to the development of type 2 diabetes and CVD. AIM: To investigate in obese subjects the postprandial effects of a low-GI vs. high-GI food product on metabolic risk markers.

    "BriefSummary": "The flexibility of the hamstrings is a very important component both for general health and when exercising. The lack of hamstring flexibility has been related to the increase in the likelihood of suffering a large number of musculoskeletal pathologies, due to the possibility of causing important muscle imbalances, which include lumbar spine pathologies, such as disc hernias or spondyloarthrosis. In addition, the decrease in the flexibility of the hamstring musculature is also related to the increased likelihood of suffering muscle strains, patellar tendon tendinopathies, femoropatellar syndrome and decreased lumbopelvic rhythm.\n\nClinically, an invasive technique has appeared, known as Ultrasound-guided Percutaneous Neuromodulation (PNM). This minimally invasive intervention consists in the application of a percutaneous electrical stimulation (PES) through an acupuncture needle-like electrode that is placed in close proximity to the nerve or motor point of the muscle with ultrasound guidance. At the clinical level, the PES is always used with the therapeutic aim of relieving chronic pain and neuropathic pain. Similarly, in sports, PES is used with the aim of improving muscular activity. Therefore, according to the characteristics and the therapeutic benefits of this technique, further research is needed to discover multiple clinical indications.\n\nThe aim of this study was to examine the effects on flexibility and strength of an ultrasound-guided percutaneous neuromodulation intervention in patients with shortening of the hamstring muscles.",

Exercise could help to prevent these fractures by increasing bone strength and improving posture. Unfortunately, not all exercises strengthen bone. Exercises that do work (e.g. heavy weight lifting) are not popular with women at risk of osteoporosis. The investigators will develop a feasible exercise programme that can be done at a community centre or at home, using resistance bands. The investigators will involve women in designing the programme and incorporate strategies to support behaviour change. The investigators will then examine whether the programme improves bone density, posture or muscle strength in eighty women. Half the women, chosen at random, will take up exercise whilst the remaining half act as a control group. The investigators will take bone scans to determine bone density, and measure spinal curvature and strength, before and after the six- month programme. Findings will be useful in making recommendations as to which types of exercise increase spine bone density and will help to design future research on maximising vertebral strength. If significant benefits are seen, the investigators will develop resources such as booklets and videos so that the intervention can be widely available.",

However, given ethical reasons, whether such a medical procedure could increase the Cesarean rate compared with those who did not received neuraxial analgesia or not is yet to be known. It is difficult to perform such a study in occidental countries because they have a higher rate of labor analgesia. On the contrary, the rate of labor analgesia in China is up to date only 1%, so it can be done easily. The investigators hypothesized that no neuraxial analgesia itself were a risk factor to Cesarean section.

OBJECTIVE:The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between previous injury history and on-ice and off-ice performance of elite male ice hockey players.\n\nMETHODS: This study was designed as prospective cross-sectional study. Fifty elite men's ice hokey players included (n=50, mean age 23y 8mo, SD 5y 3mo). Off-ice performance measures were 30 m Sprint Test, Broad Jump Test, Push-up Test, Hexagon Agility Test, Plank Test. The 2 on-ice tests were 30m On-ice Sprint Test and Cornering \"S\" Turn Agility Test.The athletes' history of injury were including previous injury site, type, number and the mechanism of injury. RESULTS: In push up test, there was a significant difference in those who had left hand and right knee injuries and, athletes who had dislocation were found to be statistically significant (p \\<0.05). According to cornering s turn agility test results, athletes who had puck injury were found to be statistically significant (p \\<0.05). In 30m sprint and hexagon agility test results, athletes who had overuse injury were found to be statistically significant (p \\<0.05). There was a significant correlation between on-ice 30m sprint and cornering s turn agility tests with broad jump test and also with off-ice push-up and plank tests (p\\<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the performance tests, push up test might be a distinctive test in determining the performance of the athletes after injury. Also on-ice tests had a correlation with off-ice plank test which is the indicator of core muscle strength.",

    "BriefSummary": "Many women with lower abdominal pain have endometriosis. Endometriosis is a condition in which the lining of the uterus (endometrium) is found outside of the uterus. The diagnosis of endometriosis is usually made at surgery. The treatment of endometriosis includes medical and surgical approaches alone or in combination. The hormone estrogen stimulates the growth of the endometrium and may also stimulate the growth of endometriosis. Medical therapies that act to decrease the level of estrogen can reduce the amount of endometriosis and pain. When therapies are discontinued, symptoms often return. In addition, medical treatment for endometriosis is expensive and is often associated with weak bones (osteoporosis) and hot flashes as a result of low levels of estrogen.\n\nSurgical treatment is removal or destruction of the endometriosis tissue. Studies show the pain from endometriosis is relieved longer with tissue removal than with destruction.\n\nThis study was developed to see if surgery followed by daily doses of Raloxifene (Evista) is effective in reducing pain, for a longer time than surgery in combination with a placebo (inactive \"sugar pill\") treatment. Raloxifene acts like estrogens in some tissues and not like estrogens in others. Postmenopausal women receiving Raloxifene for the prevention of osteoporosis had an increase in bone density and an improvement of their blood lipids (fat content in the blood). However, unlike estrogen, Raloxifene does not promote the growth of breast tissue or the uterus. If Raloxifene blocks estrogen action in the lining of the uterus (endometrium) of reproductive age women, as it does in post-menopausal women, it may also limit the growth of endometriosis and prevent the return of pain.",

The cost of one case of PPD exceeds $150,000, a significant proportion of which is related to its impact on offspring. However, difficulties accessing preferred treatments (e.g., psychotherapy) result in fewer than 15% of women receiving care. While Public Health Units have played an important role in PPD detection in Ontario, Public Health Nurses (PHNs) currently lack the skills to deliver evidence-based treatment to women. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) delivered in group format is effective for treating depression in the perinatal period, and as PHNs are often the first point of contact for women experiencing PPD, with specialized training it is likely that they can deliver high-quality CBT.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to determine if PHNs can be trained to deliver group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to acutely treat PPD, reduce relapse and recurrence, improve mother-infant attachment and parenting and optimize infant emotional functioning.",

The majority (88%) of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where screening and prevention services are limited. Prevention of cervical cancer by identification and treatment of cervical cancer precursors is key, since treatment resources for invasive disease are scarce. A cervical cancer screening program cannot be effective unless it is linked with a proven intervention to prevent the development of cervical cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently released the WHO guidelines for screening and treatment of precancerous lesions for cervical cancer prevention, which recommends a screen-and-treat approach for cervical cancer prevention, with cryotherapy being the first choice of treatment for women who have a positive screen. However, these programs are still slow to be implemented in part due to the current high cost and low efficiency of cryotherapy equipment that is often prone to breaking. Jhpiego, an affiliate of Johns Hopkins University, has developed a new cryotherapy device, CryoPop, that is one tenth the cost of current equipment while also ten times more efficient. Once proven safe, feasible and effective, CryoPop could save tens of thousands of lives in low- and middle-income countries each year by preventing cervical cancer.",

    "BriefSummary": "Azoospermia , as the name suggests , refers to the condition in which there are no sperm in the semen. This diagnosis can come as a rude shock, because most men with a zero sperm count have normal libido; normal sexual function; and their semen looks completely normal too. The diagnosis can only be made by examining the semen under a microscope in the laboratory.Men with non-obstructive azoospermia have a normal passageway, but abnormal testicular function, and their testes do not produce sperm normally. Some of these men may have small testes on clinical examination. The testicular failure may be partial, which means that only a few areas of the testes produce sperm, but this sperm production is not enough for it to be ejaculated. Other men may have complete testicular failure, which means there is no sperm production at all in the entire testes. The only way to differentiate between complete and partial testicular failure is by doing multiple testicular micro-biopsies to sample different areas of the testes and send them for pathological examination. This technique is called TESA, or testicular sperm aspiration ( also known as TESE, or testicular sperm extraction) or mTESE ( micro-testicular sperm extraction).",

Another purpose of the study is to see if putting an air filter inside the car may help improve the air quality and lower health risks.\n\nThis is important because air pollution can be harmful to health. Air pollution is made up of very tiny particles (things) floating in the air around us, called particulate matter. Particulate matter is made up of dust, smoke, dirt, and gas fumes and can get into our bodies as we breathe. It has been linked to risk for lung cancer and heart disease. It is important because taxi drivers spend many hours of their day inside their cars.\n\nThe investigators hope that this study will help them find out if using air filters inside cabs will help lower the levels of pollution in cabs and reduce its effects on the health of taxi drivers. They will use these results to educate the taxi driver community.",

    "BriefSummary": "Pregnant women are at particular risk during the imminent H1N1v influenza pandemic. The new H1N1v virus requires urgent political and medical decisions on vaccination strategies in order to minimize severe disease and death from this pandemic. However, there is a lack of evidence to build such decisions upon. A vaccine will be provided in the fourth quarter of 2009, but there is little knowledge on the immunogenicity. Particularly its clinical effectiveness and duration of immunity in pregnant women and their newborn infants is unknown. Therefore, it will be important to study the optimal vaccination regimens with respect to dosing and use of adjuvant to decide future health policies on vaccination of pregnant women. We have a unique possibility to study these aspects of H1N1v infection in pregnant women in our ongoing unselected, prospective, birth-cohort study recruiting 800 pregnant mothers between Q1- 2009 and Q4-2010. Pregnant women from East-Denmark are being enrolled during the 2nd trimester and their infant will undergo a close clinical follow-up. The H1N1v pandemic is expected to reach Denmark Q4-2009. The timing of this enrollment and the imminent pandemic allows for an \"experiment of nature\" whereby the first half of the mothers completes pregnancy before the H1N1v pandemic. The other half of this cohort will be pregnant while H1N1v is prevalent in the community and will require H1N1v vaccination. The aim of this randomized, controlled, trial is to compare and evaluate the dose-related immune protection conferred by vaccine and adjuvant (Novartis vaccine Focetria) in pregnant women and non-pregnant women. In addition the protocol will assess the passive immunity conferred to the newborn from these vaccine regimes. The study will provide evidence-based guidance for health policies on vaccination for the population of pregnant women during future H1N1v pandemics.",

Postoperative complications like infection and tumor recurrence limit its application. Interferons (IFNs) are pleiotropic cytokines that involve in immunoregulatory, anticancer and restricting infection. Especially, type I IFN signaling is reported favourable for the success of conventional chemotherapeutics, radiotherapy and immunotherapy. In addition, type I IFN can regulate the activity of almost all immune cell types (including T cells, macrophages and innate lymphocytes), creating a well-established immune environment to defense infectious and relapsing disease. Implants are rapidly coated with extracellular matrix proteins and immune protein components for the formation of a typical capsule. At the specific time point before implantation, the locally utilized of IFN in intracavity breast is assumed to modify cellular immune responses thus contributing to decreasing infection and tumor recurrence.\n\nPURPOSE: This non-randomized phase I trial aims to explore dose range of IFN\u03b1-2a. Adverse events are observed to assess drug safety and human tolerance index.",

However, the literature is scarce regarding the influence of dual-task training on changes in gait parameters.\n\nThe purpose of this prospective, blinded randomized controlled trial is to compare the short- and long-term effects of dual-task and aerobic training on gait stride variability and superior cerebral functions of independent community-dwelling elderly women.\n\nThe participants will be randomly allocated into either experimental or control groups.The experimental group will undertake 50 minutes/day of dual-task training, three times/week over 12 weeks, totaling 36 sessions, whereas the control group will receive the same doses of aerobic training. At baseline, after 18 and 36 sessions, and 12 weeks after the cessation of the interventions, researchers blinded to group allocations will collect the outcome measures.The interventions will be delivered by trained physical therapists.\n\nPrimary outcome will include gait stride variability, which will be assessed by a movement analysis system: the GaitRite\u00ae system, during cognitive and motor dual-tasks, at both normal and fast speeds. Secondary outcome measures will include a battery of global and specific cognitive function tests.\n\nThe findings of this trial may help better understand whether cognitive-motor interventions with older adults, when compared to traditional aerobic training, would result in greater improvements in gait under dual-task conditions and lead to improvements in cognitive tasks. Furthermore, the findings could potentially bring important insights regarding the impacts of improvements in walking abilities and cognition.",

The aim of this multicentre study is to evaluate anatomical and functional results of an innovative low-weight polypropylene mesh protected by an absorbable hydrophilic film in the prolapse repair by vaginal route, in comparison by the standard anterior colporrhaphy.\n\nStudy design, materials and methods This study involves 15 centres in French Private or Public Hospital. Patients will be randomly allocated to be operated by a standard anterior colporrhaphy or by an anterior repair reinforced by a specially designed mesh: UgytexTM (Sofradim, France). Ugytex is a low-weight (38g/m\u00b2) and highly porous (average porosity: 89%, pores over 1.5mm) polypropylene monofilament mesh offering tissue ingrowth and connective differentiation for a stable and long-term support. The mesh is coated with a hydrophilic film composed of atelocollagen, polyethylene glycol and glycerol. The absorbable coating protects delicate pelvic viscera from the risk of acute inflammation during the healing's inflammatory peak. Prolapse severity will be evaluated using the POP-Q system. In order to evaluate the patient's quality of life, the validated PFDI and the PFIQ questionnaires will be used preoperatively and during follow-up (3), as well as a validated questionnaire on sexual problems. The difference on one-year cure rate should be 15% (80% for the anterior colporrhaphy and 95% for the mesh repair). Then the estimated number of patient is 97 in each arm.",

However, the study of native human adult endothelial cells is difficult due to the lack of appropriate models and thereafter the endothelium is actually not easily accessible for clinical investigation. However, our results recently showed that the endothelium from human adipose tissue exhibit distinct phenotypes, including endothelial cell number and inflammatory, angiogenic and senescent state, according to adipose tissue location, i.e. subcutaneous and visceral. It is well recognized that estrogens favour gluteo-femoral adipose tissue deposit and their deficit after menopause is associated with increased abdominal and visceral fat mass as well as metabolic dysfunctions. These perturbations might be prevented with hormonal therapy. However, no data are available concerning the endothelial cells from gluteo-femoral and abdominal adipose tissues in women.",

    "BriefSummary": "Prostate cancer has been the most common neoplastic disease in men in Finland over the last ten years. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) plays an important role in screening of prostate cancer. However, PSA has a limited sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer detection. Commonly, the diagnosis of prostate cancer is done by transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) guided biopsy. Because of the low accuracy of TRUS a systematic biopsy is usually performed instead of targeted TRUS biopsy. While, as many as 47% of the ultra-sound guided biopsies may be false negative and biopsies carry a risk of increase in complications, there is an increasing interest in developing more accurate non-invasive imaging modalities.\n\nThis study will enroll 150 men with previous negative biopsies and clinical suspicion of prostate cancer due to serum level of PSA higher than 2.5 ng/ml or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) or patients in active surveillance due to low risk prostate carcinoma. Anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) at 3 Tesla (T) magnetic field using surface coils will be used to non-invasively predict the presence or absence of prostate cancer. In addition to routine 12-core TRUS biopsies, targeted TRUS guided biopsy based on MRI findings will be performed.",

The investigators compared the subjective and objective outcomes of two fat-processing methods, centrifugation and PureGraft filtration.\n\nThirty patients underwent breast reconstruction performed by a single surgeon (OM) after BCT in our department between April 2011 and September 2012. The patients were preoperatively divided into two groups randomly: 15 received fatgrafts processed by centrifugation, and 15 received fatgrafts processed by washing in PureGraft bags. The patients were followed up for 12-30 months.To measure the subjective outcome, the investigators distributed the BREAST-Q questionnaire to all the patients both preoperatively and one year postoperatively.

Compliance is problematic in that estimates show only 1/3 of women use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and only 30% are compliant. Estrogen has many documented benefits including symptomatic relief of hot flashes, improvement of the dry vagina and dyspareunia. Estrogen has been found to improve bone mineral density and increase the high- density lipoprotein portion of a cholesterol panel. To improve compliance and to provide an alternate method of delivery, we propose the use of estrogen which is admixed in toothpaste and propose to study the absorption, rate of build-up and rate of decline.\n\nHypothesis: Estrogen can potentially be absorbed systemically when toothpaste is admixed with estradiol and is applied in a timed, consistent fashion to postmenopausal or surgically postmenopausal women, not on HRT. Absorption takes place across the buccal mucosa.\n\nSpecific Aims:1) To estimate the systemic absorption of estrogen from daily use of estrogen containing toothpaste.\n\n2) To estimate the rate of build-up of serum estrogen levels based upon daily use of toothpaste containing estrogen for eight days.\n\n3) To estimate the rate of decline in serum estrogen levels when the use of estrogen containing toothpaste is discontinued for a week.",

    "BriefSummary": "Short courses of drugs can be given to HIV-infected pregnant women to reduce the chance of HIV infection being passed to her child either during pregnancy or during the labour process. However, children can also become infected by drinking the mother's breastmilk which contains the HIV virus. In many poor, developing countries in Africa, breastfeeding is the normal way of infant feeding and is vitally important because of the protection it gives to children from other diseases such as diarrhoea and malnutrition. Ideally there would be a way to make breastfeeding safer from HIV transmission without losing its other advantages.\n\nA medical study recently suggested that HIV-infected women who exclusively breastfed their children i.e. gave breastmilk but without any water, tea, formula milk or any solid foods did not pass on the virus to their children to the same degree as women who MBF with these other fluids and foods. It is important to confirm whether this observation is in fact true or not. We hypothesize that exclusive breastfeeding by HIV-infected mothers carries a lower risk of HIV transmission than mixed breastfeeding.\n\nWe propose to follow 2,100 HIV-infected pregnant women and also some HIV-uninfected women from the time that they book at the clinic until 24 months of age. HIV-infected women who say they intend to breastfeed and all the HIV-uninfected women will be visited at their homes by breastfeeding counsellors both before and after delivery to support exclusive breastfeeding. HIV-infected women who choose not to breastfeed will be helped by clinic staff to safely replace all breastmilk with some other milk. An independent team will visit all mothers at their homes and collect information about the way they feed their children. Blood samples will be collected from the children at different times by a simple heel prick and the blood stored on a piece of filter paper. By testing these samples and comparing with the type of feeding at that time, we will be able to see when a child becomes infected and whether exclusive breastfeeding gives any protection.",

The egg retrieval involves passing a needle under ultrasound guidance through the vagina into the ovaries to remove eggs that are to be later fertilized. Patients often report this as very uncomfortable.\n\nDifferent fertility clinics across the country use different methods of pain control. All clinics will use intravenous medication to control pain, while some may or may not use local anaesthetic (freezing) in the vagina. Our goal is to find the best way to control pain. Since local anaesthetic injection involves multiple needle punctures and may be painful, the investigators are unsure if local anaesthetic is necessary in addition to the intravenous pain medication.\n\nThe investigators will conduct a randomized trial where all patients will receive intravenous pain medication, but some will receive local anaesthetic injection and some will receive placebo injection. Patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire on their pain experience after oocyte retrieval. The investigators will then analyze the data and determine whether local anaesthetic actually improves pain when patients are already receiving intravenous pain medications. Through our study, the investigators aim to improve the pain experience of all women undergoing IVF in the future.",

Following reasons are invoked:\n\n* frailty of the patient\n* fear for toxicity\n* impaired mobility, rendering transportation and positioning more difficult\n* dependency for transportation to and from the radiotherapy departement\n* negative cost effectiveness ratio, due to high cost (especially for complex techniques and long schedules) and lower benefit (lower life expectancy)\n\nHypofractionation is feasible without increased toxicity, and combines better local control with patient comfort and lower costs. Further lowering the number of fractions (from 15-21 to 5) will further improve patient comfort, but is challenging when different doses are needed in the same target volume. This problem is addressed using advanced techniques permitting dose-integration.\n\nIn the elder with cancer, several unrecognized geriatric problems, including depression and cognitive impairment, can be detected by CGA . Some problems do interact with cancer treatment. In this study screening and assessment is provided to support patients and to develop an inventory of radiotherapy obstacles.\n\nOur study includes breast cancer patients, \u226570 years old, referred for adjuvant radiotherapy after surgical treatment. A schedule of 5 fractions is offered, encompassing different targets of treatment.",

    "BriefSummary": "The plantar fasciitis (PF), most frequent injury of the musculoskeletal system, is the main cause of heel pain and functional disability. The mechanical stress, stretching of plantar fascia consequently the overload on the feet, is a major intrinsic causes the onset of FP, especially when exposed to repetitive activities, such as walking. Another extrinsic etiologic factor of great influence is inadequate shoes that can lead to a deterioration and progression of the disease. One of the great difficulties of their conservative treatment is long rehabilitation period, lasting on average 10 to 18 months. Among them, the insoles stand out as one of the effective mechanical treatments to improve the immediate pain symptoms, in the short term. Other literary evidence, not specific to FP, has shown the benefits, the short and long term, a flexible footwear promotes more flexible feet and overload reduction. Objective: Verify therapeutic effect in the long term, a flexible footwear and low cost and orthopedic insole on the clinical aspect, functional and biomechanics of the gait of women with acute FP and chronic with presence of heel spur. It will be conducted a randomized controlled trial with blinded evaluator, in which 79 women with plantar fasciitis will be randomized and allocated to the intervention group with minimalist flexible footwear (MFG, acute n=12 and chronic=15) or the intervention group with orthopedic insole (COIG, acute n=14 and chronic n=14) or control group (CG, n=24). The intervention will have duration six months, six hours a day, seven days a week (42 hours/week). For all groups will be allowed to use pain medication support (paracetamol 500 mg) with a maximum dose of two grams daily. The primary outcome will be the symptom of pain verified by visual analogue scale (VAS), the inability to areas of the feet by the total score of the FFI (Foot Function Index), health feet by FHSQ-Br questionnaire (Foot Health Questionnaire Status) and the distance traveled by the six-minute walk test (6MWT). The secondary: plantar pressure and ground reaction force during gait, paracetamol consumption and the joint angles of the lower limbs. The effects of time (Start, 3 and 6 months), group (GIC and GIP CG) and interaction (time and group) are calculated by means of ANOVA case-wise two factors. A 5% alpha to significant differences and Cohen coefficient for describing the size effect of the intervention is assumed.",

    "BriefSummary": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) encompasses pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and continues to be a major patient safety issue after reconstructive plastic surgery. Significant morbidity and mortality is associated with VTE events. This disease entity represents the most common cause of preventable in-hospital death as evidenced by over 100,000 annual VTE-related deaths in the U.S. The associated economic burden is substantial, with annual costs to the U.S. healthcare system in excess of $7 billion.\n\nCancer patients have been identified as a particularly vulnerable patient population. Of these, breast cancer patients represent the largest group treated by plastic surgeons. An increasing number of breast reconstructions are performed in the U.S. with a documented 35% increase in the annual number of breast reconstructions since 2000. Over 106,000 breast reconstructions were performed in 2015 alone.\n\nOf all reconstructive modalities, autologous breast reconstruction using abdominal flaps is associated with the highest risk for VTE. We believe that a key element rendering these patients susceptible to postoperative VTE is inadequate duration of chemoprophylaxis. This is supported by the observation that VTE risk remains elevated for up to 12 weeks postoperatively. We hypothesize that lower extremity deep venous system stasis is a procedure-specific key contributing factor to postoperative VTE risk.\n\nThis study examines the duration of postoperative lower extremity venous stasis to identify patients who might benefit from extended chemoprophylaxis. We will use Duplex imaging technology to examine the lower extremity deep venous system preoperatively, on postoperative day 1, and on the day of discharge to determine if patients display radiographic evidence of lower extremity venous stasis at the time of hospital discharge.\n\nA better understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to the development of VTE as well as surgical means that reduce VTE risk factors have the potential to optimize VTE prophylaxis, thus, favorably impacting clinical outcome in a large patient population.",

    "BriefSummary": "One of the proposed ideas for malaria elimination includes the use of drugs to interrupt malaria transmission by exhausting the human reservoir of infection. Theoretically, mass treatment of an entire population with a very effective and rapid-acting drug (for instance an ACT), followed by the administration of an effective prophylactic regime during a minimum of four weeks, so as to outlast the typical development period of Plasmodium parasites in Anopheline mosquitoes, could achieve the same objective. In this respect, chloroquine (CQ) would be an appropriate candidate. This drug exhibits two conditions that make it attractive for elimination campaigns: 1) It has been demonstrated to have an excellent safety profile, allowing for its use in all age groups including pregnant women and children; and 2) Its relatively long elimination half life (t1/2=1-2 months) can provide a long post-treatment prophylactic effect. Recent evidence suggests that CQ sensitivity may be returning in places where discontinuation has reduced the drug pressure to the parasite populations. In countries such as Malawi, P. falciparum seems to have regained full sensitivity to CQ, and molecular markers of antiCQ resistance have nearly disappeared. While this does not support the reintroduction of CQ as first line therapy, it does suggest that, if proven sensitive in a given area, it could play a prophylactic role in malaria elimination strategies when used in combination with other drugs or tools. Thus, we intend to evaluate the potential role of chloroquine in preventing infections during elimination campaigns by performing a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial in asymptomatic Mozambican adults.\n\nChoosing asymptomatic parasitaemic adult males from a malaria-endemic area as our study population introduces limited risks when administering a drug with an uncertain efficacy (47% efficacious in 2001-2002). In malaria-endemic areas, this age group has a remarkably low risk of developing severe disease (irrespective of clinical symptoms), and it is foreseeable that parasitemia may be well tolerated, and in certain cases, spontaneously cleared from the individual's blood as a result of the immune system. In the unlikely event of any clinical symptomatology appearing throughout the follow-up, individuals will be examined by a study clinician and treated immediately with the country's first-line malaria treatment (artemether-lumefantrine, Coartem \u00ae).",

Complications vary from delayed wound healing, infection, skin flap necrosis, patient discomfort and repeated visits to the out patient clinic. The key to reducing seroma formations seems to partly lie in the obliteration of dead space. The use of electrocautery has been demonstrated to increase seroma formation following mastectomy, however no other surgical devices (laser scalpel, argon diathermy and ultrasonic scalpel) or substances have proven to be superior in seroma reduction.\n\nNo prospective randomized controlled trials have been able to demonstrate which techniques are superior in reducing seroma and as a consequence patient discomfort in patients undergoing mastectomy. In a previous retrospective observational study these investigators demonstrated that mastectomy flap fixation significantly reduced seroma formation and the number of seroma aspirations. In a pilot study that was recently performed in one of the investigators hospitals, ARTISS tissue glue was used for skin flap fixation and showed promising results. The investigators hypothesize that obliteration of the dead space following mastectomy will significantly reduce seroma formation, its complications and the discomfort it causes patients undergoing mastectomy.",

This project focuses on the role of potassium in human blood pressure regulation. A potassium rich diet lowers blood pressure and some studies have shown an increase in blood pressure during potassium depletion. Thus an inverse correlation between potassium intake and blood pressure exists. In this trial the objective is to test how an oral potassium supplementation, administered in form of the drug Kaleorid\u00ae, interacts with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the sympathetic nervous system.\n\nMethods This is a randomized clinical placebo-controlled double-blinded crossover trial. A group of healthy men will be randomized to either 4 weeks treatment with the drug Kaleorid\u00ae, 750mg, 3 tablets 3 times daily or to 4 weeks treatment with placebo.\n\nOn day 26 in the first treatment period the participants meet at the hospital to start a 24-hours ambulatory blood pressure and collect a 48-hours urine sample. The same day a blood sample, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a fat biopsy from the gluteal region will be done. The fat biopsy is expected to contain resistance vessels, which are to be investigated further in the laboratory.\n\nOn day 28 in the first treatment period the participants meet at the hospital again and are tested with an intravenous Angiotensin II infusion followed by continuous measurement of blood pressure and the following aldosterone response (using blood samples). Blood pressure will be measured with Finger Plethysmography and vascular tonus will be evaluated with the use of Impedance Cardiography, Finger Plethysmography and Doppler Ultrasound measurements of blood flow before, during and after the Angiotensin II infusion.\n\nAfter this first period of treatment and testing a \"washout\" period of two weeks is inserted. After \"washout\", the participants crossover and starts the second treatment period.\n\nFeasibility All necessary authorities have approved the trial and all cooperation is established.",

Letters were followed up with a phone call and potential participants were screened for eligibility. To be able to participate, participants had to be African-American, female, between the ages of 18-29, single, and have at least one act of unprotected sexual intercourse within the last 6 months. Members who were eligible and willing to participate completed a 1-hour baseline assessment survey; STD testing for Chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, and HPV; a vaginal swab that was used to determine if they had unprotected sex. They were then randomized into one of two study conditions: (1) a 2-session HIV risk-reduction condition with a safer sex relapse prevention component (2) a 1-session control condition in which participants receive general women's health information and brochures. Participants received a booster session at 6 and 9 months to reinforce intervention materials. Participants completed an assessment survey and received STD testing at 6 and 12 months.

    "BriefSummary": "The aim of this study is to measure the effects of bupivacaine administered via epidural catheters on indices of motor blockade ascertained during the second stage of labor. This is a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial designed to address the primary research question: Does bupivacaine lengthen the second stage of labor? The secondary research question is: Is there other evidence of motor blockade attributable to bupivacaine during the second stage of labor?\n\nThe investigators know from prior studies that the length of the second stage in nulliparous women delivered at Parkland Hospital without epidural analgesia is 28 minutes. The investigators hypothesize in this now proposed study that epidural analgesia with bupivacaine will significantly increase this baseline from 28 minutes to 37 minutes or more (a 33% increase) thus implicating motor blockade. Baseline data for the Bromage and Breen scores during the second stage as well as the uterine contractility data are not available as these indices of motor blockade have not here-to-fore been studied in this context.\n\nCurrently at Parkland Hospital, 82% of nulliparous women undergoing induction of labor at term receive continuous epidural infusions with bupivacaine during the first and second stages of labor. Such women will be identified when admitted for scheduled inductions at Parkland. After informed consent is obtained standard management of labor induction will be provided. Those consented women reaching 8 cm cervical dilation will be randomized. Group I will receive bupivacaine plus fentanyl via epidural catheter during the second stage (i.e. 10 cm dilation) and Group II will receive only fentanyl infusion via epidural catheter (see study procedure below). Both the patient and the caregiver will be blinded as to whether the patient is in the bupivacaine plus fentanyl arm or the fentanyl only arm. To detect a 33% increase (from 28 minutes to 37 minutes) in the primary outcome the investigators need a total of 310 women enrolled in the study (or 155 per arm). Assuming a 30% consent rate and given that approximately 1000 women meet the inclusion criteria each year at Parkland, the investigators project that this study could be completed in 12 months.",

    "BriefSummary": "Rapid administration of crystalloid immediately after induction of spinal anesthesia (coload) to be more effective in terms of managing hypotension as compared to administering crystalloid before spinal anesthesia (preload).\n\nPhenylehrine infusion is a safe and effective way to reduce incidence and frequency of hypotension during SA for cesarean delivery. Hypotension was virtually eliminated by use of high-dose prophylactic phenylephrine infusion at a rate of 100 \u00b5g/min and rapid crystalloid coload up to two liters (administration at the time of SA). However, incidence of reactive hypertension was frequent up to 47% with decrease in maternal heart rate (HR). This may raise concern in patients in whom increase of blood pressure may be detrimental, like chronic hypertension and in the presence of a compromised uteroplacental blood flow. A recent study found that infusing phenylephrine at a fixed rate of 75 and 100 ug/min is associated with more episodes of hypertension than placebo or the lower infusion rates of 25 and 50 ug/min respectively. However, there was no reduction in the number of physician interventions (phenylephrine boluses and stopping the infusion) needed to maintain maternal systolic blood pressure within 20% of baseline among all groups. Prophylactic fixed rate infusions may have limited application in clinical practice, and a variable rate (i.e. modifying the rate according to hemodynamics) has been advocated. The bolus administration of phenylephrine to treat hypotension is still commonly used, but requests multiple interventions from the anesthesiologists and is time consuming.\n\nEighty patients scheduled for cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia will be assigned to one of two groups. Immediately after spinal injection, rapid crystalloid colaod of lactated Ringer of 15 mL/kg over a period of 10-15 min will be initiated. Patients in Group I will receive infusion of normal saline (placebo) and patients in group II variable infusion rate of phenylephrine started at 0.75 ug/kg (close to the dose of 50 ug/min recommended for fixed infusion rate). The number of interventions needed to maintain maternal systolic blood pressure within 20% of baseline, hemodynamic performance, intraoperative nausea and vomiting, and umbilical cord blood gases will be compared between the two groups.\n\nWe will define a reliable and safe method to ensure maternal hemodynamic stability during spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery with the least physician interference.",

This trial is focused on patients with one of the most severe forms of the disease, X-linked inherited RP (XLRP). This disease is characterized by early onset (typically loss of night vision as a child) followed by loss of peripheral vision as a teenager and young adult. There is no male-to-male transmission of the disease in the family.\n\nThere is no cure for RP and treatment options are limited. Two clinical trials have not found a benefit from nutritional supplementation with the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), at low daily doses although there is evidence that it slows disease progression in certain instances. In this clinical trial, we propose that a high dose nutritional DHA supplement will slow the loss of visual function and preserve usable vision in patients with XLRP.\n\nThis study is a 4-year placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial meaning that patients have a 50-50 chance of receiving placebo or experimental treatment. A total of 66 patients will be enrolled; 33 will receive placebo and 33 will receive the treatment. Entry criteria include diagnosis of XLRP by an ophthalmologist, age 7 to 32 years, male, sufficient visual function such that disease progression can be followed for the entire duration of the trial, and a willingness to visit the testing site (Dallas, TX) once a year.\n\nAnnual visual function testing includes ETDRS visual acuity, full-field and multifocal electroretinography (ERG), static peripheral visual fields, and fundus photography. Cone ERG function is the primary outcome measure.\n\nFunding Source - FDA, Foundation Fighting Blindness, DSM Nutritionals",

The primary hypothesis to be assessed in this study is that antenatal ultrasound screenings performed by medical officers and non-physician health care staff will significantly reduce a composite outcome consisting of maternal mortality and maternal near miss, stillbirth and neonatal mortality in low-resource settings. Underpinning this hypothesis are two assumptions. The first assumption is that antenatal detection of complicated pregnancies will lead to appropriate referral at the right time for complicated pregnancies to comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care (EmONC) facilities. The second assumption is that ultrasound's introduction will increase antenatal attendance leading to greater rates of institutional delivery. To assess these underlying assumptions beyond the composite end point, this study will investigate the health system impact of compact ultrasound. Secondary outcomes include antenatal attendance rates, institutional delivery rates at basic EmONC facilities, referral rates to comprehensive EmONC facilities, cesarean section rates (both planned and emergent) and an assessment of medical officers and non-physician health care provider ultrasound competence and training quality.",

However, there are many obstacles to the use of IUDs including pain felt by patients during installation. Several medical means were studied without evidence of their efficacy in pain related to IUD insertion. In order to remove this brake, it's important to find another way to act against this pain. The direct technique is one of the techniques described by health professionals. It seems trusted by its users as a more reliable technique but also less painful for patients. However, there is no study available on its evaluation. The aim of this study is to investigate the interest of the direct technique in reducing the pain experienced by patients during installation.",

Different literature had different views on the association between neuraxial anesthesia and the occurrence of restless leg syndrome. Some reported that spinal anesthesia induced postoperative restless leg syndrome, but other studies showed that spinal and general anesthesia all two did not cause restless leg syndrome. A potential difference amongst these studies is that a big difference exists in surgical types. The investigators proposed that different types of surgery performed undergoing various anesthesia, and that there is a big difference in original pathophysiological condition. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that pregnant women who have special physical states would have had an association between neuraxial anesthesia and restless leg syndrome in such patients who received selective cesarean section undergoing spinal or epidural anesthesia.",

    "BriefSummary": "Ketamine is commonly used for procedural sedation and analgesia. It is widely used for trauma cases in the emergency department and is considered a superior agent in the outpatient setting due to its lack of respiratory and cardiovascular depression. In chronic opioid users, ketamine decreases acute pain and reduces postoperative opioid consumption. Few studies have examined the use of ketamine for surgical abortions. Previous studies found significant rates of emergence phenomena; however, this can be prevented if a benzodiazepine is given at the same time. Ketamine deserves further study to determine whether it is an acceptable alternative to a standard opioid-based regimen for surgical abortion. Our primary objective is to compare patient satisfaction after surgical abortion among patients receiving IV ketamine versus IV fentanyl for procedural sedation. Our secondary objectives include postoperative pain, additional pain medication used, and postoperative opioid use after the procedure. Our hypothesis is that ketamine will provide similar patient satisfaction and reduce postoperative opioid use. This will be a randomized controlled noninferiority clinical trial of 84 women receiving either IV ketamine with IV midazolam or IV fentanyl with IV midazolam for outpatient one day surgical abortions up to 13, 6/7 weeks gestation. Both groups will receive a standardized paracervical block and additional pain medication as needed. Our study has the potential to introduce IV ketamine as a satisfactory medication for outpatient surgical abortions. Ketamine may decrease the need for IV fentanyl, reduce postoperative opioid use, and may prove to be a superior analgesic for chronic opioid users.",

A variety of animal experiments indicate that endogenous PGs play a role in the regulation of retinal (RBF) and choroidal (ChBF) blood flow. There is also evidence that the prostaglandin pathway is involved in the activation of NO production in humans, however, the mechanisms for interactions between PG and NO in ocular vasculature are still unclear.\n\nAnimal studies suggest that retinal and choroidal blood flow decrease after administration of indomethacin (a nonspecific cyclooxygenase inhibitor). More recently, it has been shown that indomethacin injected intravenously decreased optic nerve oxygen tension and reduced the CO2 reactivity. This is probably the result of decreased blood flow through vasoconstriction of vessels in the optic nerve. Systemic administration of indomethacin also diminishes cerebral, renal and mesenteric blood flow by an unknown mechanism. However, no clinical trials exist so far investigating the effects of indomethacin on ocular blood flow. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of indomethacin on ocular blood flow in healthy humans.",

Phototherapy, such as low level laser therapy (LLLT) and light-emitting diode (LED) therapy, is one of the resources used to treatment muscle pain. Thus, there is a need to investigate therapeutic resources that combine different wavelengths as well as different light sources (LLLT and LED) in the same apparatus.\n\nQuestion: The aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the effects of phototherapy on pain, activity of the masticatory muscles (masseter and anterior temporal bilaterally) and joint mobility in individuals with temporomandibular disorder (TMD). A further aim is to determine the cumulative effect 24 and 48 hours after a six session.\n\nMethods/Design: A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, clinical trial will be carried out involving 30 women between 18 and 40 years of age with a diagnosis of myogenous TMD. The participants will then be randomly allocated to two groups totaling 15 individuals per group. Group 1 submitted to a session of phototherapy with 39,27 Joules per point one group will receive placebo therapy (0 Joules). The following assessment tools will be administered on four separate occasions (baseline and immediately after, 24 h after and 48 h after phototherapy). Pain intensity will be assessed using the visual analog scale for pain, meter for range of movement, and electromyographic EMG analysis on the masseter and anterior temporal muscles.\n\nDiscussion: The study will support the practice of evidence-based to the use of phototherapy in individuals with a myogenous TMD. Data will be published after the study is completed.",

One of these products is Trastuzumab.\n\nThe study processed on 50 females aged between 18 and 65, recurrent or metastatic breast cancer patients with positive HER2.\n\nThe subjects were randomly distributed in 2 groups as NNG-TMAB + docetaxel or Herceptin\u00ae + docetaxel, in blocks of 4 in a 1:1 ratio (NNG-TMAB: Herceptin\u00ae). In each block of 4 will be 2 patients in the experimental group and 2 patients in the control group.\n\nPrimary endpoint is serum peak concentrations (Cmax), area under the curve from 0 to t (AUC0-t).\n\nThis trial is intended to assess the biosimilarity of pharmacokinetic parameters, safety between Faceptor (experimental drug) and Herceptin (reference).",

While induction of labor traditionally is offered in an inpatient setting, a shift towards an outpatient setting is increasing despite insufficient evidence regarding safety and effectiveness. Oral misoprostol is easy for the pregnant women to administer and the risk of uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes is found to be low. Strong evidence concludes that oral misoprostol is preferable as an induction agent and is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe investigators will perform a multicenter randomized-controlled trial comparing labor induction in an outpatient versus inpatient setting, aiming to increase knowledge on outpatient induction of labor with oral misoprostol. The study is based on experiences and findings from a recently performed pilot trial and targets a large group of relatively healthy pregnant women where induction of labor is decided.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that women induced in an outpatient setting will be more satisfied than women induced in an inpatient setting.",

Overall, in more than half of cases, prostate biopsies performed in search of a prostate cancer are negative. In this population, there is no consensus recommendation on how to care, leading to repeated invasive biopsies, potential sources of complications.\n\nThe PCA3 urine test (ProgensaTM, GenProbe) is an innovative diagnostic tool to predict the positivity of prostate biopsies, especially in patients who had at least one negative biopsy. Proposed in clinical practice in France as a commercial kit, it is expensive and is not covered by health insurance. It is therefore essential to assess the medical and economic impact of its introduction into medical practice.\n\nThe investigators propose to set up a study of high standard of proof, multicenter, based on recruitment of patients treated in hospitals. This working hypothesis is that the availability of the PCA3 test results would reduce the number of invasive biopsies performed incorrectly in patients already had at least one negative biopsy, thus improving the diagnostic strategy of prostate cancer.",

Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent, which causes a reversible and competitive blockade of the lysine binding sites on plasminogen molecules. It is a synthetic analog of the amino acid lysine and its action is to reduce blood loss. TA is widely in use in the field of obstetrics. Both antepartum and postpartum hemorrhage(PPH) is being treated by TA extensively. One study demonstrated for the first time that TA administered to women with overt PPH decreases blood loss and maternal morbidity. Prevention of PPH is another indication where TA has been used. Varied doses of TA ranging from 1 mg/kg to more than 100 mg/kg have been used in various surgeries. Even in studies involving CS, the doses used were either a bolus of 1 gm or 10 mg/kg intravenously.\n\nThe dose of 1 g or 10 mg/kg is commonly used prophylactically before CS, Because of the lack of data on lower doses and TA pharmacokinetics, a low 0.5-g dose should be tested.",

Up to 80% of PPH is caused by uterine atony, the failure of the uterine smooth muscle to contract and compress the uterine vasculature after delivery. Laboratory and epidemiological studies show that low extracellular and serum calcium levels, respectively, decrease uterine contractility. A pilot study performed by the investigators supports the hypothesis that intravenous calcium chloride is well tolerated and may have utility in preventing uterine atony. The proposed research will establish the relationship between uterine tone and calcium through a clinical trial with an incorporated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) study. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, investigators will establish the effect of 1 gram of intravenous calcium chloride upon quantitative blood loss and uterine tone during cesarean delivery in parturients with high risk of uterine atony. Investigators will concurrently collect serial venous blood samples to measure calcium for PK/PD modeling in this pregnant study cohort. High-quality clinical research and development of novel therapeutics to manage uterine atony are critical to reduce the high maternal morbidity and mortality from PPH.",

    "BriefSummary": "Shortening the second stage of labor, the time spent pushing the baby out, is important for positive mother and infant's outcomes. Lack of progress of labor for any reason is the most common reason for cesarean section in women having their first baby and the second most common reason for cesarean section in women who have already had a baby. In 2014, a large study done across the United States showed increases in complications in both mother and infant when pushing was prolonged, including uterine infection, postpartum hemorrhage, more extensive vaginal tearing, shoulder dystocia, 5 minute Apgar score less than 4, infant admission to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and neonatal infections. Therefore, the challenge is to consider alternative practices in order to maximize a mother's chance of a vaginal delivery and minimize these associated risks to both mother and baby.\n\nMouth guards are used primarily in contact sports, and have been demonstrated to reduce or prevent injury to the teeth. Additionally, it has been proposed that wearing a mouth guard increases the strength of different muscle groups. A recent randomized controlled pilot study including women with their first pregnancy using a dental support device (DSD) during the second stage of labor evaluated the length of the second stage and outcomes. They found a significant decrease of 38% in the length of pushing time in the group that used a DSD. Additionally, there was a decreased rate of cesarean section in this group, however a p-value was not reported. This study only included 64 patients. A second, larger trial did not find a significant difference in pushing time, however the rate of interventions such as a vacuum or forceps-assisted vaginal delivery and cesarean section were much higher in the control group due to prolonged pushing. The results of the second study are contradictory in nature, yet the researchers do not provide hypotheses into why this may be.\n\nIt is clear from the previously mentioned studies that further research is needed. Our hypothesis is that using such a device would help women to push more effectively during the second stage of labor thus shortening the time needed to push the baby out and increasing the rate of vaginal delivery. The purpose of this study is to determine whether wearing a mouth guard in the second stage of labor affects the length of the second stage of labor and improves mother \\& infant outcomes.",

SIS is proved to be associated with kyphotic posture. Also, It was proved that changing sitting posture affects the measured ROM of shoulder joint and this implicates the influence of changing thoracic position on shoulder mechanics. Explanations were made regarding the role of thoracic spine in affecting the shoulder joint through two ways. Firstly, through affecting the mechanics of scapular movements and secondly through altering the length tension relationship of shoulder musculature. This study would aim at studying the most effective thoracic mobilization in the treatment of SIS.",

Complications of obesity, such as heart disease are often more dangerous than the cancer itself. A weight loss of even 5-10% of excess body weight is associated with improved health. Often, meeting with a doctor or person who is an expert in weight loss (bariatric specialist) is the best way to lose weight and keep it off.

    "BriefSummary": "Scientific Context\n\nHigh-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) are the causative agents for cervical cancer. Cervical cancer screening strategies rely on periodic Papanicolaou (Pap) testing. It's well-known that this test has significantly contributed to the reduction of mortality and morbidity due to cervical cancer. In France, it now seems that the screening strategy could be optimized. The two main ways are to reach the 7 million underscreened women (mass screening, self-sampling for HPV DNA testing) and to improve the screening test (HPV DNA testing, computer-assisted cytology). Self-collected vaginal samples (SCVS) for HPV DNA testing could be a relevant screening option: this technique appears reliable and it could allow to reach women who are never or seldom screened. Currently, there is no French data on the SCVS for HPV DNA testing.\n\nThe goal of this study is to determine the performance and acceptability of a population-based strategy using self-collected vaginal samples for HPV DNA testing to reach women who are not participating in cervical cancer screening.\n\nDescription of the project\n\nThis project (APACHE-1) is a part of a project called APACHE. APACHE-1 will be dedicated to the SCVS technical validation and to the comparison between different transports medium. Nine hundred women will be recruited from the 20 to 65 years consultants in the Tours University Hospital (CHRU of Tours) and in the IRSA (health centre for routine medical checkup).\n\nEach woman will collect 2 SCVS with a nylon flocked swab (Copan\u00ae microRheologics\u2122). The first SCVS will be put in a vial which contains a liquid medium. The second SCVS will be put in a dry vial. Then during the speculum examination the physician will collect a cervical sample with a Rovers\u00ae Cervex-Brush\u2122 and then rinse it into a vial containing Pr\u00e9servCyt \u2122. A blind HPV DNA testing and genotyping (Inno-LIPA HPV Genotyping \u2122 Extra) will be performed in the virology laboratory of the CHRU of Tours on all samples (SCVSs and cervical samples performed by a physician). The performance of the SCVS to detect cervical HPV infection will be assessed (gold standard test = HPV DNA testing on cervical samples collected by the physician).\n\nIn a second time (APACHE-2), the researchers will investigate to what extent offering home obtained SCVS leads to participation of unscreened women. APACHE-2 will be registered on Clinicaltrials as another project.",

The primary goal of this treatment is to prevent the cancer from coming back (recurring) elsewhere in the body, but if it makes the cancer in the breast and lymph nodes shrink it might be easier to remove. This could allow a patient to have a lumpectomy instead of a mastectomy and reduce the number of lymph nodes that the surgeon has to remove. In some cases, the neoadjuvant therapy works so well that it kills all of the cancer in the breast and lymph nodes. This is referred to as a pathologic complete response (pCR). Patients who achieve a pCR have a much lower risk of the cancer recurring elsewhere in their bodies.\n\nInvestigators aren't sure which chemotherapy drugs work best with the HER2-targeted drugs, and what combination of these drugs causes the fewest side effects.Thus, this study has two main goals:\n\n1. To find out if treatment with wPCbTP, weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin given with trastuzumab and pertuzumab every 3 weeks, leads to as many pCRs as TCHP in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, but has fewer side effects.\n2. To find out if HER2-positive patients whose cancers are not responding well after 12 weeks of wPCbTP get a better response when they are switched to a doxorubicin-containing regimen called AC for 4 cycles (8-12 weeks).",

The effect of a low GI diet on maternal oxidative stress, pregnancy and delivery outcomes and markers of risk for diabetes after birth in both the mother and baby will also be assessed. SUB-STUDY: The main purpose of the sub-study is to determine if the breast milk (BM) of women with GDM consuming a low GI diet will have a higher antioxidant capacity than the BM of women receiving a medium-high GI diet (control/standard care). The effect of a low glycaemic index diet on maternal dietary intake of specific nutrient-antioxidants (i.e. vitamin C, E, and beta-carotene) (prenatal and postpartum) and concentration of vitamin C, E, and beta-carotene in participants' transitional and mature BM will also be assessed.

This recommendation is now stronger than the previous guidelines. It can be used for women who do not respond to uterotonics or if uterotonics are not available. This procedure potentially can avoid surgery and is appropriate while awaiting transfer to a higher-level facility\".Furthermore, FIGO included Uterine balloon tamponade as a recommended second-line intervention for the treatment of PPH in their updated guidelines issued in 2012.\n\nIn 2006, the ACOG Practice Bulletin, published by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, made mention of the Bakri postpartum balloon for its specifically tailored design that enables conservative management of uterine bleeding in cases of uterine atony and other causes of PPH.\n\nThe reports demonstrated that balloon tamponade is helpful in managing PPH secondary to a wide variety of causes in resource-poor settings.\n\nOne of the new methods that could be used to control PPH is Uterine packing with chitosan-covered gauze or Celox.\n\nCelox Haemostats are dressings with natural material called chitosan to control major haemorrhage including life-threatening bleeding . They are simple and effective, stopping major bleeding.It was first used by military forces to stop sever bleeding in the scene with no other options to stop bleeding. Celox\u2122 granules are actually very high surface area flakes. When they come in contact with blood, Celox\u2122 swells, gels, and sticks together to make a gel like clot, without generating any heat. Celox\u2122 does not set off the normal clotting cascade, it only clots the blood it comes directly into contact with. Celox works on casualties using anticoagulants and anti-platelet therapy such as aspirin .",

It received ethical approval and adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines. Participants were carefully selected based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria to maintain the study's integrity and relevance to the target population.\n\nThe trial involved 96 eligible women from the Center for New Medical Technologies registry in Novosibirsk, Russia, divided into two groups through a computer-generated random sequence. One group received the active supplements, while the other received a placebo, with both groups and researchers blinded to the assignments. The supplements and placebos were produced to be indistinguishable in appearance, with dosages designed to maximize absorption and efficacy while minimizing side effects. The primary endpoint was the change in Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) scores, with secondary outcomes focusing on adverse symptoms and key hormonal changes.\n\nThe study's design also included measures to ensure adherence and minimize bias, such as drug container returns and daily reminders. The involvement of S.Lab (Soloways) was limited to manufacturing the supplements, with the research conducted independently to avoid commercial influence. The sample size calculation indicated that 48 participants per group would provide adequate power to detect significant differences in menopausal symptom reduction, aiming for a high level of confidence and statistical power.",

Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab and trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and monoclonal antibody therapy together before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.",

    "BriefSummary": "The last couple of years it has been shown that bile acids not only acts as simple emulsifiers of fat, but constitutes a complex metabolic integrator which not only have an influence on fat digestion and lipid metabolism, but also modulates the energy expenditure in (brown) adipose tissue and muscle tissue. This action is due to stimulation of the receptor TGR5 by bile acids. Recently scientists have discovered that this receptor in rodents is also expressed on the surface of intestinal L-cells (which normally secrets Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) in response to nutrient stimulation). The stimulation of this receptor has shown a GLP-1 secretion from the intestinal cells which is interesting since GLP-1 has a central role in maintaining normal glucose tolerance and thus blood sugar. Given the above, bile acids has an important impact on intestinal GLP-1 secretion. Whether these scientific findings can be proven in human beings is uncertain.\n\nThe primary hypothesis is that stimulating gall bladder emptying via Cholecystokinin (CCK) in healthy subjects will result in a significant GLP-1 response. We also hypothesize that adding orally Metformin or a sequestrant (\"a bile acid binder\") will further enhance this GLP-1 response.",

    "BriefSummary": "Postoperative pain following abdominal hysterectomy is a challenging concern as some patients suffer acute pain that could let to chronic pain over time following the surgery. Epidural analgesia which is the gold standard for postoperative pain management in abdominal surgeries including abdominal hysterectomy has side effects such as hypotension, hematoma, motor weakness of lower limbs, paresthesia, intrathecal placement of the epidural catheter and urinary retention that could prolong hospital stay. Since high frequency ultrasound machines' usage has increased in postoperative analgesia management, ultrasound guided fascial plane blocks has been performed by clinicians with high success rate. To avoid possible complications of epidural catheter placement and epidural analgesia, various techniques has been applying for an analgesic effect close to the effectiveness of epidural analgesia. These techniques include transversus abdominis plane block, rectus sheath block, wound infiltration of local anesthetics, erector spinae plane block and quadratus lumborum plane block. However, each of the plane blocks has limitations individually which prevent them to be the unique analgesic technique for postoperative analgesia following abdominal surgery. As far as the authors knowledge, there's no reported study which compares ultrasound guided erector spinae plane block versus ultrasound guided quadratus lumborum type III block (anterior quadratus lumborum block) as a preemptive analgesia technique in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy.",

Such modifications often lead to reduced physical-functional capacity in the elderly and increased risk of falls. Currently, physical exercise is widely used to improve physical performance and reduce, at least in part, postural instabilities and the risk of falls. In this context, the Pilates method may be a good strategy to improve body balance, muscle strength and, potentially, the perception of quality of life in this population, depending how the exercises are performed. This study seeks to assess whether practicing Pilates exercises in orthostatic position results in differential effects on walking mobility and postural balance in healthy elderly women when compared to the standard sequence in the Pilates method, which involves less time performing exercise in the orthostatic position. The study hypothesis is that a higher relative volume of Pilates exercises performed in the orthostatic position can promote greater benefits in terms of walking mobility and postural balance compared to the standard Pilates protocol in the elderly.",

    "BriefSummary": "Nowadays, more and more women embark on pregnancy with previous Caesarean scar. One in five pregnancies requires induction of labour. The use of non-pharmacological methods (methods without using medication) has been gaining popularity for women who are not good candidates, such as women with previous Caesarean scar, for an induction with medications such as prostaglandin. Labour induction with prostaglandin carries higher risk of uterine rupture and thus it is not routinely offered to women with previous Caesarean delivery in Sibu Hospital. Non-pharmacological methods of induction of labour appear to be safe in women with previous Caesarean delivery. However, various methods are available and the efficacy among them remain in doubt.\n\nIn Sibu Hospital, membrane sweeping, which is a type of non-pharmacological method, is routinely offered to women with previous Caesarean delivery who require induction of labour. However, membrane sweeping may not exert its labour induction effect immediately and the delivery may be delayed by up to 8 days. This may render a proportion of women to resort to repeated Caesarean section for failed induction.\n\nTranscervical Foley catheter insertion is another non-pharmacological methods for labour induction. Foley catheter, which is made from latex rubber, is inserted into the womb. The balloon will be inflated and this put pressure on the cervix and encourages dilatation. This method may successfully stimulates labour and the catheter falls out once the cervix dilates to 3 centimeters.\n\nThe benefits of the Foley catheter:\n\n* A favourable and safe option for mothers who are hoping for a vaginal birth after Caesarean. It is estimated that 4-7 in 10 women with previous Caesarean undergoing labour induction with Foley catheter will have successful vaginal births.\n* Cause the cervix to mechanically open without involving medication.\n* Reduced risk of uterine rupture compared to induction with prostaglandin.\n* Less risk of fetal distress compared to induction with prostaglandin.\n\nThe risks of Foley catheter:\n\n* Vaginal bleeding (1.8%)\n* Pain requiring removal of catheter (1.7%)\n* Baby moving from head down to breech (1.3%)\n* Fever (1%) which is lower than induction with prostaglandin.\n* The risk of uterine rupture is similar to women undergoing spontaneous vaginal birth after Caesarean.\n\nThe aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two types of non-pharmacological methods, ie. membrane sweeping and transcervical Foley catheter for induction of labour in women with previous Caesarean delivery.",

    "BriefSummary": "The aim of this study is to investigate whether there is a relation between bone mineral density of lower limbs exposed to vibration and the muscle strength gain in the knee extensors and flexors, and a relation serum sclerostin level and the muscle strength gain in the knee extensors and flexors in healthy young adult women.\n\nForty healthy young adult women are planned to include in this study. The participants meeting the criteria were randomized into two groups: the training group (20 cases) and the Control group (20 cases).\n\nThe whole-body vibration (WBV) training group will be trained on a WBV platform (Power Plate) 5 times a week for 4 weeks period. Participants will be asked to stand upright on WBV platform. Training volume and training intensity will be low at the beginning but progressed slowly according to the overload principle. The training volume will be increased systematically over the 4-week training period. The training intensity will be increased by increasing the amplitude (2-4 mm) and the frequency (40 Hz) of the vibration. The subjects will be asked to report negative side effects or adverse reactions in their training diary. In the Control group, sham stimulus will be performed by WBV platform 5 times a week for a 4 weeks period.\n\nPlasma sclerostin level and, the right and left knee flexor and extensor muscles strength will be measured before and after training period. Isokinetic torque will be measured with the Biodex (Biodex System 3 PRO Multijoint System Biodex Medical Inc. Shirley/NY USA)extremity-testing system. The right and left lower limbs bone mineral density (BMD) and muscle strength will be measured before training period. The BMD will be evaluated by bone densitometer (Norland XR-46 DXA, USA). Sclerostin levels will be measured by human sclerostin ELISA kit.\n\nThe rest muscle electrical activity of right and left knee flexor and extensor muscles will be evaluated at pre-vibration, post- vibration and, during vibration. The rest muscle electrical activity will be measured by Powerlab (data acquisition system, ADInstruments, Australia) device.",

Norwegian women are hospitalized when prostaglandins are used to induce labor. In Denmark, a neighboring country to Norway, women have been offered outpatient induction of labor using oral misoprostol for several years.\n\nThe overall aim of this study is to investigate if outpatient induction of labor is beneficial in a Norwegian setting. This includes:\n\n1. To investigate the clinical outcomes and feasibility of inducing in an outpatient setting compared to an inpatient setting in Norway\n2. To explore low-risk nulliparous women's experiences of labor induction in inpatient and outpatient settings.\n\nThis is a non-randomized prospective pilot- and feasibility study, collecting data from electronical records. In addition, the study participants are invited to write a diary during the labor induction process and a questionnaire six weeks postpartum. Eligible patients include low-risk nulliparous women induced with low-dose oral misoprostol.",

    "BriefSummary": "Obesity is an independent risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) although the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. Dietary nutrients play a key role in both the prevention and promotion of CRC. While iron is an essential nutrient, excess iron is associated with carcinogenesis. Unlike the systemic compartment, the intestinal lumen lacks an efficient system to regulate iron. In conditions when dietary iron malabsorption and intestinal inflammation co-exist, greater luminal iron is associated with increased intestinal inflammation and a shift in the gut microbiota to more pro-inflammatory strains. However, treatments designed to reduce luminal, including diet restriction and chelation, are associated with lower intestinal inflammation and the colonization of protective gut microbes. Obesity is associated with inflammation-induced, hepcidin-mediated, iron metabolism dysfunction characterized by iron deficiency and dietary iron malabsorption. Obesity is also linked to intestinal inflammation. Currently, there is a fundamental gap in understanding how altered iron metabolism impacts CRC risk in obesity.\n\nThe investigator's objective is to conduct a crossover controlled feeding trial of: 1) a \"Typical American\" diet with \"high\" heme/non-heme iron\", 2) a \"Typical American\" diet with \"low\" iron, and 3) a Mediterranean diet with \"high\" non heme iron and examine effects on colonic and systemic inflammation and the gut microbiome.",

    "BriefSummary": "Diabetes is a prevalent metabolic disease that leads to increased blood sugar levels due to insulin shortage or resistance. Type 2 diabetes is often linked to obesity, which can increase insulin resistance. Meteorin-like protein (METRNL) is a new secreted protein that affects insulin sensitivity and has been found to be negatively related to serum glucose levels in people with diabetes.\n\nOxidative stress in diabetics can stimulate the production of inflammatory mediators, increasing the activity of the antioxidant system. Aloe vera, a widely used plant, has been used for treating diabetes, wound healing, tumors, and inflammatory bowel disease. It has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, antidepressant, and memory-enhancing effects.\n\nExercise can improve diabetic patients' conditions by increasing the expression of GLUT4 protein and skeletal muscle. High-intensity interval training has been shown to increase the expression of the METORIN gene in human subjects and decrease MDA in type 2 diabetic patients. However, no studies have examined the simultaneous effect of exercise and Aloe vera on diabetes indicators.\n\nThe present study aims to investigate the response of METRNL and some oxidative and antioxidant plasma indicators to high-intensity interval training and Aloe vera supplementation in type 2 diabetic men. The findings indicate that exercise and consumption of plants with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties can be effective in modulating the pathological effects of diabetes and increasing insulin sensitivity.",

    "BriefSummary": "Research indicates that up to two-thirds of patients with advanced cancer experience significant symptom burden (e.g., anxiety and depression, pain, fatigue), yet these symptoms are not adequately addressed. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) protocols designed to teach patients strategies to increase their sense of self-efficacy to manage symptoms may be helpful in alleviating multiple cancer-related symptoms. The efficacy of CBT protocols for reducing distinct symptoms in early-stage breast cancer has been shown; however the role of CBT protocols for multiple symptoms in late-stage cancer is less clear. The current study aims to investigate the feasibility and acceptability as well as obtain an initial estimate of efficacy of a novel, cross-cultural CBT intervention that addresses multiple symptoms in advanced breast cancer patients. The target outcomes of intervention will be reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression, pain, and fatigue. A randomized controlled design will compare patients receiving a CBT protocol to a waitlist control in both Singapore and US patients. The larger goal of this collaborative effort is to determine the scalability of such an intervention that can potentially provide needed symptom burden relief to advanced cancer patients.",

To determine response rate, safety and biological effects of hydralazine and magnesium valproate when added to cisplatin chemoradiation.\n\nHypothesis. Hydralazine and magnesium valproate associated to chemoradiation will increase the clinical complete response rate to 95% as compared to 75% as seen in historical controls treated with cisplatin chemoradiation in FIGO stage IIIB patients.\n\nMetodology. A total of 17 FIGO stage IIIB patients with histologically confirmed cervical carcinoma with no previous treatment will be included. Patients will be typed for acetylator status and and then receive either 182 or 83 mg of hydralazine, and magnesium valproate at 40mg/Kg from day -7 to the end of chemoradiation (external and brachytherapy). Clinical response rate, safety and transcriptome changes will be analyzed.",

    "BriefSummary": "Auto-immune diseases are characterized by an inappropriate inflammatory response against tissues in the body and represent a major health care burden. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 play a central role in the pathophysiology of many auto-immune diseases. Innovative therapies aimed at limiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production in a more physiological manner are warranted. In previous research conducted in an individual known as \"the iceman\", the investigators found that, through a autodidact concentration/meditation technique, he appears to mount a controlled stress response, characterized by activation of the sympathetic nervous system and enhanced production of cortisol, both of which are known to result in immunosuppression. In accordance, while practicing this concentration/meditation technique, the inflammatory response during human endotoxemia (lipopolysaccharide \\[LPS\\] administration) was remarkably low in this individual. Therefore, this technique could provide a novel means of controlling the inflammatory response. However, the aforementioned results were obtained in just one subject, and hence can not serve as scientific evidence for the effectiveness of the concentration/meditation technique. The iceman claims that he can teach this technique to other subjects within a relatively short time frame. Therefore, in the present study the investigators wish to investigate the effect of concentration/meditation on autonomic nervous system activity and the inflammatory response during experimental human endotoxemia in a controlled manner, by comparing a group of subjects that are trained by \"the iceman\" and practice the concentration/meditation technique with a group of subjects which do not.",

It has been suggested that upright positions may improve childbirth outcomes and reduce the risk for instrumental delivery.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe primary objective was to test the hypothesis that birthing on the \"BirthRite\" \u00ae seat will result in a reduction in the number of primiparous women delivered instrumentally.\n\nMethod:\n\nA power calculation showed (\u03b1 = 0.05 \u03b2 = 0.2) a requirement of 460 participants in each of the two arms of the trial in order to test for a 40% reduction (from 15% to 9%) of instrumental deliveries in primiparous women at a maternity unit in southern Sweden. It was decided to subject the study to a feasibility test by conducting a pilot-study in which 68 women were randomised to give birth on the birthing seat or to give birth in any other position but on the \"BirthRite\" \u00ae seat. Randomization to birth on the birthing seat or in any other position took place when the participant's cervix was fully dilated. The primary outcome measurement was the number of instrumental deliveries. Secondary outcome measurements included oxytocin augmentation, perineal trauma, and blood loss administration of oxytocin for augmentation of labour, length of the second stage of labour, perineal trauma, perineal oedema, maternal blood loss and haemoglobin, apgar scores, cord pH and transfers to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit(NICU).",

    "BriefSummary": "Obesity among Mexican-American women has the potential to become a public health crisis. Hispanics are one of the fastest growing minority populations in the United States and the prevalence of obesity in Mexican American woman is increasing at an alarming rate. Poor dietary practices, especially food habits that are acquired as families acculturate to the American food supply, and lack of exercise are thought to be associated with women's excess weight gain. Accordingly, interventions are needed to improve the dietary intake and physical activity levels of Mexican-American families.\n\nWe propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial in which women are randomly assigned to receive either family-based behavioral counseling (FBC) sessions and play group physical activity sessions or group based nutrition and exercise classes and health related activity worksheets to complete with their child. The FBC sessions, conducted by community health advisors, will use photographs of the family's food practices, taken by mothers, as visual aids in the counseling sessions. The control intervention will consist of group sessions using curricula designed to motivate women to exercise and to promote the Food Guide Pyramid recommendations using traditional Mexican-American foods. The primary outcome of the trial is mother's BMI. The secondary outcomes are dietary intake, moderate to vigorous physical activity and household food supplies. We hypothesize that within a one year time frame, women who are exposed to the FBC will have lower BMI's compared to women who receive the active placebo control intervention. The mechanisms through which we intend to change weight status are altering the type of foods purchased and cooking practices and promoting mothers to engage in physical activities with their children during their play. Measurements of secondary outcomes include three 24 hour dietary recalls, a household food inventory and activity monitoring using MTI actigraph monitors. In addition, mothers' reports of household food security level, and food purchase motives, will be collected as covariates. Measurements will be collected within one month of completing the interventions and at six months and one year follow-up.",

The ideal way to stop preterm labor when it occurs (which drug to use) is not known. Currently magnesium sulfate is used by about 95% of all practitioners, but recent data suggest magnesium given this way may be harmful for the baby's future development. Other drugs such as antiprostaglandin agents are very effective in stopping uterine activity, but particularly when used for \\>48 hours have been associated with both maternal and fetal sides effects. Lastly, calcium channel antagonists are effective in stopping contractions and have very little in the way of maternal and fetal side effects, but less data is available in the United States on their use. Because there is no FDA approved drug to stop preterm labor, we purpose to randomize all women with preterm labor (20-34 weeks) to receive one of the above three methods of stopping preterm labor. The primary outcomes will be to see which agent stops the uterine contractions most effectively, for the longest period of time with fewest relapses and results in significant prolongation of pregnancy. If one of these agents is clearly superior to the other two it would help women avoid early delivery or have significant extension of their pregnancy to avoid some of the complications of preterm birth in the baby.",

Decreased barometric pressure, which leads to low blood oxygen levels, is the primary casual factor of AMS. Symptoms of AMS are characterized by headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue and difficultly sleeping. Moreover, when people travel to high altitude, cognitive performance and endurance exercise capacity are impaired. Therefore, the goal of this research is to identify effective pharmacological agents that will help reduce the symptoms of AMS and improve physical and cognitive performance at high altitude.\n\nThe investigators will study the efficacy of the dietary supplement, quercetin, the drugs nifedipine (extended release) and methazolamide taken together, the drug metformin, and the drug nitrite in reducing symptoms of AMS and improving cognitive and exercise performance at high altitudes.",

    "BriefSummary": "Background of the study: The accurate assessment of local cervical cancer spread (i.e. invasion) is of clinical importance for staging and treatment considerations. For example, if parametrial invasion is absent, radical surgery is the treatment of choice for tumors less than 4cm in diameter. However, if such invasion is present, the patient has become inoperable and (chemo)radiotherapy is warranted. Unfortunately, regular 1.5T MRI as a part of staging work-up has a limited accuracy for detecting loco-regional tumor invasion. Due to relatively frequent false-negative findings a risk of understaging and under-treatment occurs. For such cases adjuvant treatments with (chemo)radiotherapy are indicated after the initial surgery, causing increased morbidity and treatment associated risks. For higher stages, with primary (chemo)radiotherapy, a more reliable MRI based delineation of local tumor spread could enable individualized dose(volume) and field modifications.\n\nHypothesis/aim of the study: To develop and in vivo optimize T2w ultra high field (7T) MRI sequences, which use a combination of an endorectal and external coil, to image the (para)cervical area for assessment of the loco-regional tumor status in cervical cancer.\n\nStudy design: The proposed study is an investigator initiated, single center, prospective pilotstudy.\n\nStudy population: 20 patients with histological proven cervical cancer stage IB1, IB2, IIA of IIB will be included.\n\nPrimary study parameters/outcome of the study: Optimized T2w ultra high field (7T) MRI sequences of the (para)cervical area which allow qualitative assessment of the loco-regional invasion of cervical cancer.",

    "BriefSummary": "Patient experience moderate to severe pain after abdominal surgery. This post-operative pain can also contribute to complications such as respiratory impairment, cardiovascular events, ileus, sleep deprivation and mood disturbance. Opioid based patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is commonly employed but opioids have the side effects such as respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting, sedation, pruritus and urinary retention. Bowel motility can also be affected. Consequently alternative or adjunct analgesic medications without these side-effects have been investigated in order to reduce opioid consumption.\n\nMultimodal analgesia is a technique whereby a combination of analgesic drugs with different modes of action can be used to improve analgesia and decrease adverse effects by virtue of synergism. Postoperatively, with adjunctive analgesia, PCA morphine consumption as well as the side effects may be reduced. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to be opioid sparing and decrease the adverse effects of PCA morphine. A recent review showed that acetaminophen combined with PCA could induce a significant opioid-sparing effect but the incidence of PCA morphine related side effects were not reduced.\n\nIt is common nowadays to give oral analgesic supplements to post-operative patients on PCA morphine. Tramadol, an analogue of codeine, is one of the choices. However, some of the patients cannot tolerate the side effects such as nausea, drowsiness, sweating, postural hypotension and dry mouth. Combination of tramadol 37.5 mg and acetaminophen 375 mg, which has been used successfully to treat post-operative pain, may improve analgesic response with better tolerability.\n\nThis study is to assess tramadol 37.5 mg and acetaminophen 375 mg combination on the efficacy of pain control, down stepping of morphine consumption and related adverse events with PCA use after open colorectal surgeries.\n\nObjectives:\n\nThis study aims to compare and evaluate:\n\n* The efficacy of tramadol/acetaminophen combination on postoperative pain relief after lower abdominal surgeries\n* The effects of tramadol/acetaminophen combination on the consumption and the duration of PCA morphine use\n* The adverse effects related to this regimen\n* The effects on postoperative bowel function, tolerability of fluid and diet, ambulatory function, sleep, and duration of hospital stay\n* The overall satisfaction of the patients",

Metformin has recently received increasing attention because of its potential antitumorigenic effects that are thought to be independent of its hypoglycemic effects. It has been extensively studied in preclinical models, which have implicated several molecular pathways in its antitumor activity.\n\nMetformin was proved to have anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects on tumor cells.Moreover, metformin enhances the T-cell mediated immune response to tumor tissue and fights metastases. Also, epidemiological studies have shown that metformin, but not other antidiabetic drugs, reduces cancer incidence and improves survivability in diabetic cancer patients.\n\nThe proposed research in this application will investigate two prime questions with regards to the combined use of metformin together with traditional neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. First, the hypothesis that the simultaneous use of metformin along with doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/paclitaxel neoadjuvant protocol produces better antitumor outcomes will be tested. Second, the study will examine if the improved apoptotic effect of such regimen is paralleled by exaggerated stimulatory influences on apoptosis biomarkers.",

There are many different techniques currently in use for repairing inguinal hernias and with the advent of laparoscopy, yet another technique is being advocated. Laparoscopic repair has been reported in some studies to be superior to open repair because of less pain and earlier return to work. However, laparoscopic repair requires a general or regional anesthetic and expensive equipment and supplies to perform. There is also evidence that open tension-free mesh repair may have results similar to laparoscopic repair for these patient centered outcome measures. The general acceptance of this procedure, especially in the VHA, has not been uniform. Furthermore, no randomized trial of sufficient size and power to be conclusive has been done to set forth the operative \"gold standard\" for hernia repair.",

According to the most recent comparative risk assessment, 3.5 million people die prematurely each year as a result of HAP exposures. While uncertainties remain regarding causal links between HAP exposures and health, the time is ripe for focused research into effective interventions. Limited past research has shown that the demand for clean cookstoves is low, and that households continue to use traditional hearths even when they have clean stoves. The investigators propose to harness an existing cohort in Ghana to study factors that increase the adoption of clean cookstoves, and to test strategies to promote adoption and continued use.",

This decline has thought to be the result of improved surveillance of normal and abnormal fetal behavior and using that information to determine those babies at risk for stillbirth.\n\nThere are many tools available for surveillance. One of these tools, the bio-physical profile (BPP), incorporates a non-stress test (NST) with ultrasound assessment of fetal behavior . This test has been used for about the last 30 years with good safety and efficacy. The ultrasound evaluation includes monitoring fetal breathing, fetal gross and fine movement and amniotic fluid evaluation. NST and BPP have been found to have similar ability to predict fetal well-being, with similar safety and ease of performance. Several studies have observed the effect of sound as well as light on the NST and have found that it can shorten testing time without altering its ability to be interpreted properly or affecting fetal safety. However, similar studies have not been done with the BPP. Light stimulation has been proven to be safe for both the mother and the fetus with no harm having been demonstrated when used with NST.",

    "BriefSummary": "Muscle protein synthesis can be stimulated by ingestion of protein sources, such as whey, casein or soy. Protein supplementation can be useful to restore protein turnover after exercise but also to preserve skeletal muscle mass and function in aging adults. Ingestion of large doses of essential amino acids (EAA) or certain protein supplements may be an effective strategy to induce muscle protein synthesis. However, in many cases, it may not be practical or feasible to consume a large volume of amino acids or protein required for an effective response by muscle. Several evidences show how reduced strength and muscle mass, even in early life, are predictors of early mortality which explicit the importance of developing more effective methods to improve muscle quality. Therefore, identifying the better sources of protein that have higher anabolic potency is of high significance.\n\nThe goal of this study is to determine the anabolic potency and efficacy of a new and novel Whey Protein Hydrolysate mixture (WPH) on skeletal muscle protein synthesis in healthy young subjects (age 20-35 yr). Previous studies on rats indicate WPH induces significant increases in muscle protein synthesis compared with carbohydrates or whey-amino acid mixture. WPH contains mostly peptides, which have physiological effects and could be absorbed more rapidly. Preliminary data from preclinical study has also demonstrated that WPH can stimulate muscle protein synthesis at lower doses compared with intact whey proteins. Thus, WPH could be absorbed more rapidly and may maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis. Although there is substantial data on the individual effects of BCCA and intact protein such as whey, there have been no clinical investigations that have explored the efficacy of WPH for stimulating muscle protein synthesis in humans.\n\nTherefore, the investigators propose that WPH will increase muscle protein synthesis.\n\nThey will compare the response of WHP to the response of WHEY when equal protein is provided in both treatments.\n\n10 healthy subjects will be recruited and will receive both WPH and WHEY supplementation in a single blind crossover design. Muscle protein synthesis will be measured on both occasions. This acute study will allow to determine whether low dose WPH supplementation will be an effective nutritional treatment to stimulate muscle protein synthesis in young adults.",

The development of interventions which can successfully increase levels of physical activity in adolescent girls in Northern Ireland is of key importance. The aim of this intervention is to investigate whether or not girls (aged 11-13 years) can increase their daily levels of physical activity over a 12 week period by taking part in a school-based brisk walking intervention. The impact of participating in a school-based brisk walking intervention on a range of other outcome measures will also be investigated. A total sample of 200 adolescent females will be recruited onto the study, with recruitment of participants taking place at the school level. Following written consent from parents/guardians and assent from participants, participants will be randomised at the school level to either participate in the walking intervention or to act as controls. Objective physical activity will be assessed at 3 time points using an Actigraph accelerometer. At baseline, post-intervention (12 weeks) and follow up (4 months post-intervention) participants will also undergo measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, bloody pressure, and cardiorespiratory fitness. Participants will also complete questionnaires assessing levels of physical activity and a number of psychosocial variables at each time point.

This is due to the reduction of nitrate to nitrite by the action of bacteria in the mouth and the reduction of nitrite to NO depending on the acidic pH on the stomach or by enzymes with nitrite-reductase activity. The acidic environment of the stomach is very important to the formation of NO and S-nitrosothiols and several studies suggest that changes in gastric pH can affect this conversion. In this context, bariatric surgery, by altering the anatomy of the stomach and increasing gastric pH, can affect the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway and change the antihypertensive and antioxidant effect of sodium nitrate.",

An \"anterior wall prolapse\" occurs when the front of the vagina loses its support, and the bladder drops down and rotates into the vaginal opening. The bladder can cause a bulge out of the vagina.\n\nOne of the treatment options available is to repair the anterior wall surgically. The goals of surgery are to return the anatomy to its usual position, ensuring that all the pelvic floor organs (bladder, vagina and rectum) can function properly. The ideal surgical repair would also be long lasting.\n\nTwo surgical options are routinely performed in Calgary for repair of an anterior compartment prolapse. One option involves fixing the organs back in place using sutures. The other option uses sutures plus a mesh made of small intestine submucosa (SIS) that is already licensed for use in Canada. The SIS mesh is slowly absorbed after it is placed in the pelvic area. The investigators do not know which of these two options is the best surgical procedure. Both may have different advantages that would result in better results. This study is designed to try and find out if one of these procedures is better, and if a larger study may be needed.",

The endogenously produced unconjugated bilirubin is one of the most powerful anti-oxidants of the human body and the administration of bilirubin in animal experiments has been shown to protect from inflammation-induced death. However, bilirubin for human administration is not yet available. Therefore, we wish to exploit one of the side effects of atazanavir, a registered drug currently used as a protease inhibitor in HIV infected patients. Atazanavir inhibits the enzyme UPD glucuronosyl transferase enzyme (UGT1A1) and therefore increases endogenously produced bilirubin levels moderately. To study the effect of hyperbilirubinemia during inflammation we will apply the human endotoxemia model. The human endotoxemia model permits elucidation of key players in the immune response to a gram negative stimulus in vivo, therefore serving as a useful tool to investigate potential novel therapeutic strategies in a standardized setting. We hypothesize that atazanavir-induced hyperbilirubinemia has beneficial anti-inflammatory and vascular effects during human endotoxemia.",

The intervention group will will undertake a fully supervised structured exercise training programme, consisting of both aerobic and strength training exercise, taking the form of two 70-minute group fitness classes per week for six weeks. These participants will also undertake a 30-minute walk in their own time. The control group will continue to go about their normal daily activities. Measurements will be made before and after the intervention/control period, including assessments of disease activity (e.g., by gauging how swollen and tender patients' joints are using the Disease Activity Score(DAS) ) and assessments of fitness and/or physical functioning (e.g., 200 meter timed walk test, a strength test, a flexibility test, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQDI)). Blood samples will also be collected from patients before and after the intervention/control period to measure markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR).

The 20-minute pad test uses 250 mL of sterile water instilled directly into an empty bladder with a catheter rather than relying on walking for 30 minutes at the beginning of a one-hour pad test. We previously reported that 20-minute pad test has better sensitivity than the one-hour pad test in women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Due to the different bladder capacity in each patient, we tried to infuse strong-desire (SD) amounts of water that can more precisely reflect the full bladder capacity in each patient. We found an even better sensitivity when the 20-minute pad test was infused with SD amount of water in women with SUI compared with infusion with 250 mL of water in the bladder.\n\nAs to short-term pad test, previous studies had some concerned about the reliability and reproducibility. Thus, undertaking our previous two studies, we want to evaluate the test-retest reliability of the 20-minute pad test infused with SD amount of water in bladder in women with SUI.",

In order to induce muscle loss, participants will be required to lie flat on their back on a water bed filled with water and salt (called hyper-buoyancy flotation (HBF)). As this situation is similar to that experienced in space, the investigators will also measure the effect of HBF on sleep, brain and physiological function - all things known to change in astronauts. Sixteen male subjects (18-40 yrs) will be recruited to participate in the study that will require physiological testing before, during and following both 7 days of normal conditions and 7 days of HBF bed-rest. Each subject will be exposed to the same conditions and assessments over the study period. As some loss of muscle is expected, participants will be offered an exercise rehabilitation programme upon completion of HBF with self-monitored and/or guided sessions based on those provided by the Space Medicine Office of the European Space Agency to returning astronauts.",

The women will be randomly allocated into three different intervention arms, a control arm with usual care and two different training arms. All participants will respond to questionnaires and have blood samples and taken and for a subgroup muscle biopsies before and after the exercise intervention. Participants will be supported to uphold exercise through collaboration with Friskis \\& Svettis and followed for 5 years. Some of the women will also be asked to participate in an in depth interview about the experiences of exercise during ongoing treatment. This study will contribute to increased knowledge about the type, intensity and frequency of training that patients with breast cancer benefit most from with regards to impact on physical and mental wellbeing. This knowledge is of great importance since experience shows that patients and relatives often seek information about rehabilitation, self-care and physical activity. The study will also contribute to the improvement of the patients\u00b4 quality of life, ability to return to work, and reduce social costs, but above all, increase the possibility for development and implementation of evidence-based rehabilitation of women with breast cancer during and after active treatment.",

    "BriefSummary": "Miscarriage is the most common complication of pregnancy. As many as 15-25% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, and the number of miscarriages in England is estimated to be approximately 125,000 per year. Miscarriage often brings not only physical pain, bleeding and risks of infection, but also psychological impacts on women and their families. This study will focus on women whose pregnancy sac remains inside the womb (known as a missed miscarriage) and opt for medical management of their miscarriage up to 13+6 weeks of pregnancy. NICE currently recommends that a drug called misoprostol (a vaginal pessary or oral tablet that makes the womb contract) should be used in the medical treatment of miscarriage. However, there is evidence to suggest that combining this drug with mifepristone (an oral tablet that reduces pregnancy hormones) may be more effective in treating miscarriage. Therefore, to test this in a clinical trial, participants will be allocated at random to receive either mifepristone followed by misoprostol, or a dummy drug (placebo) followed by misoprostol. Neither the participants nor the researchers will know what allocation is decided, which is necessary to test the treatments fairly. The main outcome of interest will be whether miscarriage is complete within 7 days of randomisation. If miscarriage is not complete then further treatment (more tablets or surgery) will be offered. A number of other key outcomes, such as the need for an operation, will also be assessed. We will also study the views and experience of the participants regarding the tablet treatment.\n\nWe anticipate that 710 women will be required to take part in the study to answer this question with confidence. We estimate that we would be able to recruit this many women in two years.",

    "BriefSummary": "Hormonal therapy is the standard treatment for prostate cancer which has spread to other areas of the body. Despite the high initial response rates to hormonal therapy, the vast majority of men will develop cancer which is no longer responsive to hormone deprivation. The average time for hormonal therapy to be effective is about 18 months. Chemotherapy combinations which can treat the disease when it no longer responds to hormonal therapy have been developed, but these treatments are not curative. One of these combinations is estramustine, etoposide and paclitaxel. In men with far advanced disease, 60% will have a decrease in their PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) or shrinkage of tumors after treatment with this chemotherapy. Despite this, these men have all developed further disease progression requiring additional treatment. One possible way to make chemotherapy more effective is to give it when the number of tumor cells is smallest, and the number of cells to be killed is at a low level. One situation in which this is true is when a man has responded to hormonal therapy any tumors are at their smallest size. This study will test whether the addition of chemotherapy at that time will prolong the time until the cancer becomes unresponsive to hormonal therapy.",

The findings of this study will illustrate whether the addition of sodium alginate to chocolate milk will improve the glycemic properties of chocolate milk and will potentiate its satiating characteristics. This study will also elucidate whether sodium alginates, incorporated into chocolate milk, will influence glycemia, appetite sensations and food intake in a dose-dependent manner. It is hypothesized that there will be a synergy between milk and sodium alginate beyond either alone. When combined with milk components, sodium alginate is expected to improve glycemia and induce satiety more than does either milk alone or alginate alone.",

Interventional treatment, such as transversus abdominis plain (TAP) block requires an additional intervention and has relatively short effect, also could not be applied in outpatient conditions. The hypoalgesic effect of transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) is well known for many years, but effectiveness during postoperative period is still controversial and maybe therefore didn't come to daily practice. However it could be a promising part of multi-modal pain treatment for hernia patients. This study analyse the hypoalgesic effect of TENS and its impact on hernia specific quality of life (QoL) after Lichtenstein hernia repair.\n\nAim#1 To determine whether use of TENS is effective for acute postoperative pain relief.\n\nAim#2 To determine whether use of TENS have impact on hernia specific QoL in early and late postoperative period.\n\nAim#3 To identify factors associated with effectiveness/ineffectiveness of TENS procedures.\n\nAim#4 To determine whether a psychological condition (depression, anxiety and pain catastrophisation) is somehow associated with TENS effectiveness.",

This proposal begins the proof-of-concept pilot study in women with a history of breast cancer to deliver a multi-component intervention to improve vulvo-vaginal atrophy with a vaginal moisturizer, and sexual energy and self-image with a mind-body intervention that involves relaxation and subconscious suggestions with a hypnotic induction delivered via audio file. The primary outcome will be to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a multi-component intervention for sexual function.

    "BriefSummary": "Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) is a primary prevention program that was developed by Dr. David Olds in the United States (US) with the goal of helping vulnerable young first-time mothers and their children. The program involves public health nurses (PHNs) visiting mothers in their homes, providing intensive supports starting in pregnancy and continuing until children reach their second birthday. Studies in the US have shown that NFP significantly reduces child maltreatment and child behaviour problems, while also improving children's early learning and mother's economic self-sufficiency. Economic studies have also shown that the program pays for itself over the long-term. However, NFP has never been tested in Canada. Due to major differences in our populations and in our public services, we do not know whether NFP will show the same benefits here. We therefore plan to conduct a scientific evaluation of NFP's effectiveness in British Columbia (BC), in close collaboration with the BC government and BC's Health Authorities. Using randomized-controlled trial methods, NFP's effectiveness will be specifically evaluated in comparison with existing perinatal services in BC regarding outcomes across three fundamental domains: 1) pregnancy and birth; 2) child health and development; and 3) maternal health and life course. Findings from this evaluation will be used to improve the NFP program - to better meet the needs of vulnerable young mothers and their children in BC.",

    "BriefSummary": "This study will use an experimental method of delivering the enzyme glucocerebrosidase directly into the brain of a patient with Gaucher disease to treat disease symptoms. Patients with Gaucher disease have insufficient levels of glucocerebrosidase. As a result, substances normally broken down by this enzyme accumulate in the body, causing damage to the brain and other organs. Symptoms of Gaucher disease outside the brain can be treated by infusing the missing enzyme intravenously (IV, through a vein). However, IV infusions do not help the neurologic symptoms of the disease, because the enzyme cannot get into the brain. This study will use a new technique called convection-enhanced delivery to try to introduce glucocerebrosidase directly into the brain.\n\nThis single-patient study includes an 8-month-old male with Type 2 Gaucher disease with progressive neurological decline.\n\nIn preparation for the enzyme infusion, the patient will have a complete physical examination, including a detailed neurological examination, and blood and urine tests. On the day of surgery, the child will be placed under general anesthesia for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. For this procedure, the child lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a narrow cylinder), wearing earplugs to protect his hearing from the loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. He will then be brought to the operating room for the infusion procedure, as follows:\n\nAn incision will be made in the scalp and a small hole drilled through the skull. Then, a small tube (cannula) will be positioned through the hole into the target area in the brain. Once the tip of the cannula is in place, it will be connected with tubing to a syringe filled with glucocerebrosidase in saline (salt water). The child will then have a second MRI scan to make sure the cannula is placed correctly and to monitor delivery of the glucocerebrosidase to the brain. The child will be monitored closely with MRI scans every 30 to 60 minutes during the infusion to look for fluid in the brain and determine the extent of the enzyme perfusion. The infusion will last no longer than 6 hours and will be stopped when the full dose of enzyme has been delivered. The cannula will be removed and the scalp incision closed. The child will stay in the hospital for observation from 4 to 10 days, with at least 24 hours in the intensive care unit and 3 to 7 days in the pediatric unit.\n\nThe child will be seen in the clinic two weeks after discharge and then once a month for 3 months to evaluate any possible effects of the surgery. These follow-up visits include a repeat MRI scan and neurological examination. After the first 3 months, visits may be less frequent.\n\nIf the child continues to have symptoms during the course of follow-up or his neurologic status worsens, additional enzyme infusions will be offered, possibly including treatment of the brainstem. If the child gains no benefit after three infusions have been performed, no additional infusions will be offered. If there appears to be any neurological benefit, additional infusions may be offered.",

To counteract the prevalence of WRMSD, human-robot interaction could improve the power of a person and reduce the physical strain. For the lower back, a reduction of spinal loading could be helpful. The passive upper-extremity exoskeleton Laevo\u00ae is developed to support physically heavy work: it supports the back during bending and should, consequently, result in less low back pain (Laevo\u00ae, the Netherlands).\n\nOBJECTIVES The primary aim of this study is to assess to what extent wearing the exoskeleton changes:\n\n* muscular activity of the erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles;\n* knee compression force;\n* posture of the upper and lower spine, trunk, hips and knees; ...in different tasks (static vs. dynamic), different trunk postures (trunk flexion vs. trunk flexion and rotation) and different knee postures (straight vs. stooped).\n\nSecondary aims of this study are to assess to what extent wearing the exoskeleton changes:\n\n* muscular activity of the trapezius descendens, rectus abdominis, vastus medialis and gastrocnemius medialis;\n* perceived discomfort;\n* heart rate;\n* internal loadings on the spine, using a lumbar spine model;\n* the performance of subjects during functional activities (e.g., stair climbing) when wearing the exoskeleton (either turned on or off); ...in different tasks (static vs. dynamic), different trunk postures (trunk flexion vs. trunk flexion and rotation), different knee postures (stoop vs. squat), and different static holding positions(0\u00b0 vs. 30\u00b0 vs. 60\u00b0) with different weights (0kg vs. 8kg vs. 16kg).",

    "BriefSummary": "Young African-American women who report a higher frequency of alcohol use have particularly higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sex behaviors. Unfortunately, there are no evidence-based HIV interventions designed to be gender- and culturally-appropriate for this population. To address this, the investigators propose to add to the CDC-defined evidence-based intervention (DEBI), Horizons, a new intervention form, Group Motivational Enhancement Therapy (GMET), which has shown promise in reducing alcohol use and alcohol-related HIV risk-taking. To test how effective the combined Horizons+GMET alcohol-specific portion is, it will be evaluated with a time equivalent Horizons+attention control general health promotion (GHP) portion focusing on nutrition health promotion, and to an enhanced standard-of-care program. In this study, 600 young African American women, 18-24 years of age, who report 3 or more occasions where they drank alcohol in the past 90 days will be recruited to complete a four-part baseline assessment consisting of: 1. an audio computer assisted self interview (ACASI), 2. videotaped communication role plays to objectively measure communication skill ability (subsample), 3. provide a vaginal specimen to test for STDs and 4. Provide a urine pregnancy screen. After participants complete their baseline assessment, they will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 1. Horizons+GMET alcohol-specific condition, 2. a time-equivalent Horizons+GHP condition, or 3. an enhanced standard-of-care control condition. The GMET alcohol-specific component has shown to be effective in influencing several alcohol-specific concepts (attitudes, norms, self-efficacy) and reducing sexual risk-taking among culturally-diverse high-risk youth. The GMET alcohol-specific module was designed to increase woman's awareness of the unfavorable effects of alcohol on themselves, their sexual decision-making, and their male partner and teaches women strategies to reduce the possibility of engaging in sex under the influence of alcohol. In addition, the GMET alcohol-specific module provides skills training needed to effectively talk about sexual intentions to use condoms and/or refuse risky sex when they or their male sex partner has been using alcohol. After completing one of the three conditions, participants will complete a brief ACASI posttest to evaluate immediate changes in hypothesized social and psychological mediators of safer sex and alcohol use. Participants will also return to complete follow-up assessments at 3, 6, 9, and 12-months after their intervention. If the Horizons+GMET intervention is observed to be effective, investigators will work closely with the CDC DEBI program to help distribute the intervention to public health agencies and community based organizations (CBOs).",

However, there has been little focus on the recovery of people with self-harm scars. Medical skin camouflage (MSC) is a British National Formulary-listed topical cream designed to cover skin conditions. Research on MSC has focused on its use with non-self-harm marks e.g. burns. The evidence from this research suggests that the cream helps women feel better and do more activities. There is little/no evidence about the effects of the preparation for women who self-harm and for prisoners.\n\nThis research was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Research for Patient Benefit Programme. In the research the investigators will examine whether it is possible and practical to use MSC in prison. The investigators will ask women prisoners and staff what they think about the cream. The research has four parts. In the first part the investigators will run focus groups with women prisoners and prison staff to find out the best way to deliver the MSC intervention and how to measure its effects. In the second part the investigators will design a programme for delivering the MSC. The investigators will then train 6-10 long-term prisoners to become skin camouflage practitioners. The final part will involve a small randomised controlled trial with 40 women prisoners; 20 will be allocated to the intervention group and will use the MSC for 6 weeks. The investigators will measure their mood, thoughts of self-harm and wellbeing before and after they use MSC. The investigators will compare these results with 20 women who have not used MSC (waitlist control group). All women taking part will be placed at random into the control or the treatment group. The control group will receive the MSC after the research has ended.\n\nPotential benefits of this study may be an increase in self-esteem and quality of life for the women prisoners. As women recover they may be less likely to self-harm.",

Thus respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) biofeedback, which has shown promise in other conditions associated with an autonomic nervous system imbalance, could be effective in FMS. With the aid of sensors and computers, biofeedback involves modifying and/or learning how to control normally involuntary processes like blood pressure, heart rate and the autonomic nervous system through relaxation and breathing. The goal of this study is to test the effectiveness of a 10-session RSA biofeedback treatment for the symptoms of fibromyalgia. Forty patients receiving the RSA biofeedback treatment will be compared to 40 patients receiving another form of biofeedback thought to be minimally helpful (control group). Later, control group patients will also receive the RSA biofeedback treatment. We will study improvement in symptoms like pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and depression in the RSA biofeedback group and compare these improvements to those in the control group. We will also assess whether these improvements persist over time and what if any changes in the autonomic nervous system result from the treatment.",

In most patients with breast cancer the locoregional recurrence rate (LRR) is low, however still high LRRs are found in certain patient groups, especially in locally advanced, inflammatory and triple negative breast cancer. Olaparib is a potent PARP inhibitor developed as an anti-cancer drug for homologous recombination (HR) defected tumors and as a dose intensifier for chemo- and radiotherapy. The combination of olaparib and radiotherapy is expected to improve locoregional control and thereby overall survival in both breast cancer patients with a high probability of locoregional recurrence and patients with HR deficient tumors. However, this combination treatment has never been tested in humans before. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of radiotherapy to the breast and regional lymph nodes with concurrent olaparib.",

The amount of nicotine delivered via the CN electronic cigarette will be compared to the amount of nicotine delivered from smoking a regular cigarette and from using the Nicorette\u00ae Inhalator.\n\nElectronic cigarettes aim to mimic the experience of cigarette smoking, by delivering nicotine rapidly. Unlike cigarettes however, they do not contain all of the many harmful combustion products contained in tobacco smoke.\n\nElectronic cigarettes are readily available in many markets, and may contain significant quantities of nicotine. However, they are not regulated as medicines, and their manufacturers can make no medicinal claims about them.\n\nSuch products are unregulated, having not been subjected to regulatory review by either the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) or any Notified Body.\n\nIt is the intention of CN Creative (makers of the CN electronic cigarette) to submit an application to the MHRA for the CN Electronic Cigarette, in order to make a high quality, regulated product available. Males aged 18-65, who smoke and who have no intention of stopping smoking during the trial are eligible to take part in this study.

    "BriefSummary": "Adductor canal block (ACB) is a new technique gaining acceptance as an alternative analgesic method of femoral nerve block (FNB) following knee surgery. The advantage of ACB is its dominant sensory nerve block effect. It preserves quadriceps muscle strength compared with the FNB. This will serve as potential gain for early rehabilitation and thereby functional outcome. Adequate direct injection of local anesthetic into the canal will block four nerves: the saphenous nerve, the nerve to the vastus medialis, the medial femoral cutaneous nerve, and the terminal end of the posterior division of the obturator nerve. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is often associated with postoperative severe pain. Postoperative early rehabilitation is the primary focus to restore pre-injury status and is an essential part of the full recovery, especially that this rehabilitation extents over a 6 month period. Early elimination of pain is necessary to achieve this goal. However, there are no clear conclusive clinical reports defining the adequate analgesic volume-dosage of local anesthetic for ACB for postoperative ACL pain management. The investigators speculated that volume-dosage manipulation play key role in the effective of ACB for postoperative pain. The investigators conducted this prospective, randomized, observer-blinded trial to compare 3 combinations of volume and dosage of 0.25 % bupivacaine for US-guided ACB. The first aim of the investigation is to compare the analgesic effect of ACB 0.25% bupivacaine of the 3 doses as assessed by the visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores. The second aim were duration of analgesia, as defined by first demand for analgesia, and subsequent 24-h consumption. Physiotherapy tolerance and time to discharge were evaluated.

Participants in both groups are then regularly asked to rate their pain levels up to 24 hours after surgery. In addition, the pain killers they receive and length of hospital stay are recorded. There is a chance that the participants who receive the ropivacaine will benefit from lower pain levels after surgery. There are no notable risks of participating.",

Research in animal models suggests synaptic plasticity in the prefrontal lobes as well the amygdala and hippocampus are impacted by the prenatal cannabis exposure; regions associated with both cognitive and emotional control, thus influencing long-term deficiencies in attention and impulsivity. This pilot study will collect preliminary data on the structural impact of in utero cannabis exposure on region-specific morphology and structural connectivity of white matter tracts that connect to the prefrontal lobes and the limbic regions shortly after birth, before confounding by the postnatal environment becomes a major influence.",

Participants were randomly assigned to follow either a lower-fat (LF) diet or a moderate-fat (MF) diet for weight management in a parallel-arm design. The two phases of the study were a weight-loss phase (phase 1) and a weight-maintenance phase (phase 2) (Figure 1). During phase 1, months 1 through 4, participants consumed a hypo-caloric diet consistent with the 2005 Dietary Guidelines in the free-living environment. During phase 2, months 5 through 12, participants shifted into weight maintenance. It was hypothesized that a weight-loss intervention at the extremes of dietary fat recommendations of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines would be equally effective for weight loss while achieving comparable nutrient adequacy. Also, Overall, the lower-fat and moderate-fat diets would both be nutritionally adequate, based on the Healthy Eating Index.",

    "BriefSummary": "Introduction:\n\nCesarean section (C/S) is usually performed under spinal with preservative free morphine for pain relief, but the investigators have a severe shortage of this formulation of morphine. Hydromorphone is a narcotic which acts peripherally and centrally to decrease pain. It has been used in spinals for postoperative pain relief and in pain pumps for relief of chronic pain. No randomized controlled studies have evaluated intrathecal (IT) hydromorphone for post C/S pain.\n\nMethods:\n\nThis is a randomized double-blind controlled trial utilizing the up-down sequential allocation method1,2 to find the best dose of IT hydromorphone that provides pain relief following C/S. Patients will be given a morphine PCA pump for additional pain relief. Our first patient will receive 200 mcg of IT hydromorphone. Pain, nausea, and itching will be evaluated at 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours following the C/S via numeric rating scales; vomiting and morphine use per hour will be recorded. Success will be a median morphine usage of less than or equal to 1mg/hour in the following 16 hours. If a success, the next patient will be given 10 mcg less IT hydromorphone; if a failure, she will receive 10 mcg more. The study will end after 5 successes.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe primary objective is to find the optimal dose of IT hydromorphone for pain relief following C/S. The secondary objectives are to define the incidence and severity of hydromorphone's side effects and determine the duration of analgesia.",

The surgery of this anomaly is very painful in the postoperative period and requires long-term analgesia. Regional anesthesia methods combined with general anesthesia play an important role in providing effective and long-term postoperative pain control in pediatric penile surgery. These methods also reduce postoperative morbidity, enable early mobilization and significantly decrease the need for narcotic analgesics.\n\nThe investigator's hypothesis is peripheral nerve blocks are superior to neuraxial blocks as the blocks provide longer-term analgesia and have fewer side effects.",

    "BriefSummary": "Dehydration lowers both physical and mental performance if it is severe enough. Performance declines are more pronounced in hot conditions or after prolonged strenuous activity such as exercise. Most individuals drink less than their sweat losses during activity, while some individuals overdrink and develop a sodium deficiency. Water and electrolyte balance must be restored as part of the recovery process after any activity that causes sweating. Plain water causes a decrease in plasma sodium concentration and osmolality, which reduces the desire to drink and increases urine production. Unless the volume ingested exceeds the loss, individuals are in net negative fluid balance throughout the recovery period due to urinary losses. When sodium and potassium are added to rehydration fluids, urine production is reduced in the hours following rehydration. Rehydration is only possible if a volume of fluid equal to or greater than the amount lost through sweat is consumed, together with adequate electrolytes. The two test products for this study, are novel hydration beverage formulas. They are an electrolyte drink mixture with five essential vitamins and three times more electrolytes than typical sports beverages. The test products create an osmotic force that permits water to be supplied to the bloodstream sooner in the digestive system by using a specific ratio of sodium, glucose, and potassium. This randomized, placebo-controlled, semi-blind, crossover study will evaluate the effects of the test products on rehydration in healthy adults.",

    "BriefSummary": "Each year, approximately 1500 breast biopsies (1000 microbiopsies and 500 macrobiopsies) are performed in the radiologic department of the Montpellier Cancer Institute (ICM). This exam, which is relatively easy for the radiologist, can however lead to major anxiety for patients. Indeed, previous studies show that about 50% of women undergoing a breast biopsy have significant anxiety affects.\n\nAnxiety associated with the risks of biopsy, potential breast cancer diagnosis and/or lack of routine sedation procedures increase patient concerns. Distress prior to biopsy is associated with greater pain and discomfort during the procedure. The psychological distress that persists after the biopsy is related to a worse psychological management of side effects of the biopsy breast (e.g., sensitivity, skin irritation).\n\nLimiting apprehension, worry and anxiety induced by the uncertainty linked to the biopsy results and the biopsy-related pain should be an integral part of the medical care through the patient follow-up during, after and until the diagnosis is announced. In light of these challenges, new alternative methods are emerging to enhance patient knowledge, develop procedural skills, improve confidence and mitigate procedural anxiety. However, to our knowledge, few methods have been developed during this period of 'waiting-time'. Currently, only care instructions and a consultation to announce the results (about 10 days after the procedure) are proposed to patients at the end of biopsy. Patients are also encouraged to call if they suspect complications such as infection or bleeding.\n\nIn this context, the investigators propose to integrate a pain management after biopsy via e-health system through the patient's medical care. Radiologist/patient communication could have an impact on patients' anxiety and health-related issues, given the challenging nature of discussions around need for breast biopsy and potential implications of the results. Indeed, paying attention and focusing on symptoms as patients experience them improves their empowerment and their adjustment to the disease.\n\nWeb-based systems that can provide electronic-Patient reported Outcomes (e-PRO) have been shown to prompt clinicians to intensify symptom management, to improve symptom control and to enhance patient-clinician communication patient satisfaction, as well as well-being. In addition, it is known that improved communication between patients and medical staff to less anxiety after a biopsy and that anxiety is related to pain.\n\nTaken as a whole, these elements encourage the integration of e-health and e-PRO for the management of pain and anxiety in patients undergoing a biopsy. The benefits of e-PRO are still being discussed in terms of quality of life (Qol) and psychological distress. The investigator propose to integrate two types of e-health intervention: 1/e-PRO collected by connected objects (smartphone or tablet) as they were used in previous studies, and 2/ e-PRO collected by a phone consultation, which values human communication between the medical staff and the patient.\n\nIn case of significant pain, the collection of e-PRO by any of these e-health interventions will generate an alert and a reactive and responsive care.\n\nIn fine, the purpose of this research is to improve the medical organization and care of post-biopsy patients by proposing an innovative connected patient technology, regardless of their remoteness from the hospital.\n\nSocial inequalities will be reduced by lending a tablet to patients who do not have such a device with a 4G key.",

The investigators do not fully understand the cause(s) of preterm birth but it occurs more frequently when the normal, healthy bacteria (called Lactobacilli) in a woman's birth canal are replaced with unhealthy bacteria. Previous attempts to get rid of the unhealthy bacteria with antibiotics have not shown to affect the risk of preterm birth. The reason for this may be that what is required is the replacement of Lactobacilli in the birth canal. This can be done by asking women to take capsules containing lactobacilli once daily. To study whether oral Lactobacilli capsules compared with dummy capsules can reduce the risk of preterm birth, a large study involving approximately 10,000 women would be required. But the investigators do not know whether women would agree to take part in and complete such a study, and this is what the investigators wish to study in the small, initial study described here. The results of this study will show whether probiotics produce the desired biological effects on vaginal bacteria, and whether it would be feasible to perform the larger, definitive study of their effectiveness in prevention of preterm birth.",

Anesthetic blockade of the sympathetic outflow of the spinal cord causes vasodilation, and is one cause of this hypotension. The higher the spread of the blockade will result in a higher incidence of hypotension. Injected hyperbaric medication has about 15 minutes to spread within the intrathecal space before it will be taken up by the nerve roots. The time that a patient remains in one position after medication injection will affect the spread of the resultant anesthetic block. A patient who is left sitting for a longer period of time after injection of hyperbaric medication will have a lower level of block than someone who is placed supine immediately. In this study, the investigators wish to use up down sequential analysis to determine the time period a patient should remain seated after intrathecal injection of hyperbaric bupivacaine that will result in a 50% rate of hypotension.",

    "PrimaryCompletionDate": "2010-11",
    "BriefSummary": "Introduction:\n\nPostpartum depression (PPD) occurs in large numbers of women (between 10 - 20%) and substantially affects both their own well-being and their offspring's mental and emotional development. Whereas PPD is a form of major depression, its etiology is probably related to a combination of biological (hereditary, hormonal etc.), and psychological factors. In practice, most women suffering from PPD do not seek treatment, or are treated with psychotherapy alone due to concerns regarding pharmacotherapy. This is despite the obvious importance of reaching a rapid remission in these women. In fact, data regarding the treatment of PPD with antidepressants is surprisingly sparse and is limited to only one blinded and placebo-controlled study (with fluoxetine) and a number of studies without a placebo arm . The reason for the paucity of double-blinded placebo-controlled studies is probably due to 3 main limiting factors: Firstly, the reluctance of women to \"admit\" to and seek professional help due to depression, Secondly, the difficulty to administer antidepressant medication to lactating women, and, Thirdly, the ethical difficulties in designing a study with a real placebo group.\n\nIn contrast to the very limited number of drug studies in this population, there are a number of studies that have shown the efficacy of psychotherapy in the treatment of PPD. Positive studies have been published using different types of psychotherapy, including cognitive, dynamic and interpersonal psychotherapy.\n\nThe investigators propose to study the efficacy of psychotherapeutic treatment in women suffering from PPD with add-on sertraline in a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled design. To overcome the difficulties described above in studying antidepressants in the postpartum period, the investigators propose to include active brief dynamic psychotherapy for all women. Furthermore, the investigators will selectively allow inclusion of women who only suffer from either mild or moderate major PPD (not severe / suicidal) .\n\nHypothesis:\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that women with PPD randomized to the arm receiving psychotherapy + active sertraline will show a greater response rate than the psychotherapy + placebo group. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that the difference in response between the 2 groups will demonstrate a significant early response in the active sertraline group.",

This study aims to demonstrate that a glucocorticoid (dexamethasone), already in common use for other conditions, (eg to treat medical conditions such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis in early pregnancy), will reverse the endometrial glucocorticoid deficiency and as a result reduce menstrual blood loss.\n\nThe study is in two stages, a 12 month workup stage and a 3 year, response adaptive, dose-finding randomised controlled trial. The first stage involves two workup clinical studies to gather preliminary safety and efficacy data from first-in-Heavy Menstrual Bleeding use of oral dexamethasone. They will also provide methodological data for a series of simulation studies to determine a robust adaptive trial design specification.\n\nWorkup study 1: is unblinded, six patients will be given Dexamethasone (0.75mg twice daily) for 5 days during two consecutive menstrual cycles and will have an endometrial biopsy and MRI on two occasions (in a nontreated cycle, and the second of the cycles treated with Dexamethasone). Workup study 2\u037e is a doubleblind crossover trial of 14 women -2 treatment blocks of two cycles each, with either placebo or Dexamethasone (0.75mg twice daily), randomised to order of treatments blocks - placebo then Dexamethasone, or vice-versa.\n\nAdaptive trial: 54 month double-blind, placebo controlled trial of 108 women to evaluate the effect of Dexamethasone across a range of doses with the aim of identifying the optimal dose to be studied in a subsequent Phase III trial.\n\nParticipants will be randomised to receive one of 6 active doses or placebo over 3 menstrual cycles.\n\nAll studies will involve asking participants to complete menstrual diaries and to carry out menstrual blood loss collections to objectively measure blood loss.\n\nThe investigators' proposed approach is novel use of synthetic glucocorticoid to \"rescue\" luteal phase deficiency of cortisol, and thus improve endometrial vasculature and hence vasoconstriction when menses commences, and thus reduce menstrual bleeding.",

This condition is called lipodystrophy.\n\nPatients who take medicine for HIV and who have lipodystrophy report loss of subcutaneous (sc) fat from the arms, legs, and face and excess fat gain in the neck and truncal region. They also more likely to have problems with insulin in the body, high fat levels in the blood and diabetes. The reason that lipodystrophy develops is not fully understood although some HIV drugs have are very likely the cause. The complications pose an increased risk of fat blockage forming in the arteries making you more at risk for heart problems in the future. Changes in body fat can cause physical discomfort and psychological distress. Management of these problems can be a challenge for the patient's doctor.\n\nThe investigators propose data collection to determine if there is more than one reason why this might happen in some people and not in others. Laboratory samples being collected: 1) special imaging of the liver; 2) fat collected by needle from the mid thigh and mid-shoulder areas; 3) blood samples to measure the virus, t-cells, fats, and other markers of how the patient's body is handling the virus.\n\nThis study is being done because science does not fully understand why some patients with HIV who take medicines for the virus have abnormal fat loss or gain and some do not.

    "BriefSummary": "Low birth weight (LBW; birth weight\\<2,500g) is the most important determinant of mortality and morbidity in the neonatal period. It is also a very important factor in predicting nutritional status, health and development in childhood. It even influences health in adult life, contributing to the vicious cycle of disease and poverty. The high rate LBW in DCs represents therefore a major public health problem. Maternal chronic energy deficiency is assumed to be a major determinant of the problem in these countries along with prenatal micronutrient deficiencies. A large body of recent evidence points out that multiple micronutrient supplementation as such has only a modest beneficial effect on fetal growth. Therefore, it is expected that providing these multiple micronutrients in a food supplement covering energy requirement needs of pregnant women will have an effect of public health importance on children's health.\n\nThis study has the objective of improving children's health by improving birth outcome and fetal growth through the provision of a food supplement enriched in multimicronutrients during pregnancy.\n\nThis research includes 2 constituents:\n\n1. a pilot phase during which dietary behavior of pregnant women is assessed as a component for optimal fetal growth\n2. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, including 1300 pregnant women aimed at testing 2 hypotheses: supplementing pregnant women with a food supplement containing a multivitamin-minerals mix will improve fetal growth; improved fetal growth will have a positive effect on health and growth during infancy.\n\nThe trial is planned in Hounde District, Burkina Faso, in collaboration with Centre Muraz, which plays a leader role in research and services providing at the district level and in policy recommendations at the national level. This will ensure that the study findings are incorporated into on-going district programs with possible replication at the national level. The research lasts from February 2006 to August 2009.",

      "Drug Interactions Between Clopidogrel and Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors"
    ],
    "PrimaryCompletionDate": "2012-12",
    "BriefSummary": "Clopidogrel is a platelets inhibitor that is widely used particularly during and after acute coronary events and coronary interventions. Several studies have shown that some patients are resistant to clopidogrel. The resistance mechanism is not entirely clear, but at least in part it is related to interactions between medications. Clopidogrel is a pro-drug converted in vivo to its active metabolite by CYP2C19 and CYP3A in the liver. Consequently drugs that inhibit the CYP2C19 can affect the production of the active metabolite and cause \"clopidogrel resistance\". Therefore the FDA has recently published a \"safety alert\" which recommends avoiding cross treatment with clopidogrel and drugs that are expected to inhibit CYP2C19 (including omeprazole, fluvoxamine, cimetidine, fluconazole and others). Nevertheless there no clear evidence in the literature for clinical relevance of such interactions.\n\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are group of antidepressant drugs that are widely used for treatment of depression and anxiety. SSRIs are considered to be very safe with favorable side effect profile, hence many patient after coronary events who suffers from behavioral and emotional disturbances are treated with those drugs. However there are several reports that SSRIs can inhibit platelet function and increase bleeding tendency particularly in concomitant administration with aspirin. The proposed mechanism is blocking of platelets serotonin reuptake that result in platelet dysfunction.\n\nFluvoxamine - is a member in the SSRI family and a potent inhibitor of the CYP2C19. Theoretically fluvoxamine should have two conflicting effects on the response to clopidogrel. Pharmacokinetically it is expected to decrease the clopidogrel responsiveness due to inhibition of CYP2C19 and reduction in the production of the active metabolite. On the other hand \"pharmacodynamically\" fluvoxamine may directly inhibit platelet aggregation due its effect on serotonin reuptake, thus increasing the effect of clopidogrel. Other SSRIs that do not interact with the CYP2C19 such as citalophram are expected to have only pharmocodynamic effect on platelet aggregation.\n\nAlthough both clopidogrel and SSRIs are widely used in the last decade and concomitant treatment is quite common, no data is available about in influence of the interaction between those drugs on platelet function and on clinical events. The net effect of fluvoxamine and other SSRIs on platelet function in the presence of clopidogrel is not known.\n\nThe aim of the investigators study is to assess the effect of two SSRIs fluvoxamine and citalophram on platelet aggregation and to test the effect of these drugs on the laboratory response to clopidogrel, in healthy individuals.\n\nStudy design: randomized, double blinded, controlled crossover trial. Primary study end point: Change in % platelet aggregation and VASP phosphorylation after treatment with clopidogrel + fluvoxamine or clopidogrel + citalophram as compared to each drug alone.",

The drinks will be labeled with a stable isotope of carbon and samples of breath collected every 20 minutes after consumption of the drink. This will allow gastric residence time to be calculated. The pilot will also fulfill two secondary objectives. At the same time as the breath samples are collected MRI scans of the upper abdomen will be made so that gastric volumes can be measured in order to compare the two methods of measuring gastric emptying rates. Additionally, samples of saliva will also be collected after every MRI scan for subsequent mass spectrometry analysis.

    "BriefSummary": "Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men in Canada. Over 30% of men over the age of fifty have histological evidence of prostate cancer on biopsy. Despite the stage migration afforded by early detection with serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing and an apparent trend toward improved survival over the past several years, prostate cancer remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Biochemical failure after primary therapy (surgery or radiation) remains a significant health care burden and strategies to delay clinical prostate cancer progression and prolong the interval from treatment failure to systemic therapy would be of significant clinical benefit for those men suffering from a finding of PSA recurrence.\n\nPSA is widely accepted as the most useful prognostic marker of prostate cancer progression, particularly after primary therapy with radical surgery or radiation. 5 Despite improved cancer control rates with definitive management of early stage prostate cancer, a PSA recurrence is unfortunately a common occurrence (25-50%) in most large case series.\n\nMicroenvironmental factors have been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in the selection of neoplastic cell subpopulations expressing more malignant phenotypes and contributing to the progression of localized and metastatic disease. Very low levels of O2 (\\< 10 mmHg) has been well described in many solid tumours (including prostate cancer) and the extent of hypoxia has been demonstrated to represent an independent marker of a poor prognosis for patients with various types of cancers. Tumour hypoxia contributes to numerous adaptive phenotypes including increased invasion and metastasis, as well as evasion of immune cell surveillance increased resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Although cellular adaptive responses to hypoxia are likely mediated by various mechanisms, our previous preclinical studies suggest that decreased nitric oxide (NO)-dependent signalling plays a significant role in this progression of a malignant phenotype.",

    "BriefSummary": "Minority women and women of lower socioeconomic status are at significantly increased risk of unintended pregnancies, short inter-pregnancy interval, and short duration of breastfeeding. The consequences of poorly timed pregnancies and short duration of breastfeeding for the health of mothers, infants and children are well documented.\n\nTo decrease rates of poorly timed pregnancies, increase breastfeeding duration and address other postpartum concerns women must be engaged in their postpartum care outside of the traditional postpartum visit. In addition to contraceptive counseling and breastfeeding support, providers discuss a number of important maternal and child health issues at the postpartum visit. These include (1) screening and referral for postpartum mood disorders (2) screening for cardiometabolic consequences of pregnancy complications, (3) discussing inter-conception care and (4) connecting women with a primary care provider. Thus, as recommended by numerous professional societies, the standard postpartum visit at 4 to 6 weeks after delivery has considerable value to women's postpartum care.\n\nAttendance rates for the postpartum visit are markedly lower for women with limited resources contributing to racial and economic health disparities. Despite receiving excellent prenatal care, only 40% of the economically disadvantaged women who receive prenatal care at the Magee outpatient clinic return for their postpartum visit. These parallel national trends, where 60% of women with Medicaid insurance return for a postpartum checkup compared with over 82% of women with private insurance. Medicaid programs serve pregnant women who are particularly vulnerable to poor health outcomes and thus this gap is critical. Additionally, minority women disproportionally receive Medicaid and thus interventions that focus on Medicaid recipients have the potential to address racial as well as economic disparities. These data demonstrate that the current care model does not engage all women to make good health care decision postpartum and is disproportionately failing our most vulnerable moms and babies.\n\nEmpirically derived concepts from behavioral economics can be leveraged to design interventions that support participants to make better health decisions and may be particularly useful for postpartum care.\n\nThe feasibility trial will focus on four tenants of behavioral economics-bounded rationality (information overload), status quo bias (lack of self-control), hovering (limited attention), and framed incentives-- that have been successfully used to tackle stubborn health problems such as smoking and obesity. Importantly, unlike tobacco cessation or weight loss, many aspects of postpartum care such as compliance with the visit or uptake of LARC, do not require on-going action on part of the patient and thus may be particularly amenable to the lessons of behavioral economics.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To conduct a pilot trial evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of a future randomized trial to determine the efficacy of Healthy Beyond Pregnancy on adherence with the postpartum visit.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To determine the impact of Healthy Beyond Pregnancy on adherence with the postpartum visit.",

The dose volume constraints that predict for rectal toxicity require minimizing prostate motion and rectum and bladder filling of IMRT .5-15 . The volumetric changes and internal organ motion during prostate IMRT increases risk of PSA failure in patients with large rectums at the planning CT scans. Patient preparation for IMRT planning is crucial .The literature is limited regarding the effectiveness of educational intervention with behavioral reinforcement for patients, and a gap if exists literacy level is considered. Patients often cannot comprehend verbal or written instructions and have difficulties following through with recommended regimens.23 Using multimedia such as Internet, audio-visual media such as DVD and even the telephone can enhance patients' knowledge and understanding about importance of preparation for IMRT for prostate ca. Thomas's study showed that in patients undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the video group had lower anxiety scores compared with the non video group. At SOCC patients have been provided with verbal information about bladder and rectum preparation for prostate planning CT scan and IMRT. Patients should have a \"fullish\" bladder and empty rectum at the time of CT simulation. If the rectal diameter is \\> 4cm, the patient will be asked to empty his stool/gas and re-scanned. The 3- months review of patients preparedness for prostate IMRT showed that only 13/55 patients were adequately prepared but 42/55 (76%) of patients needed to be re-scanned due to inadequate bladder (21/42, 50%) or rectum filling 28/42, 67%) . Also, 2/13 (15%) patients were still not prepared at the second resimulation despite that they received a phone call with the instructions. The investigators plan to investigate if a multimedia education strategy will decrease costly resimulation rate for patients with prostate cancer.",

Simulation-based trainings are environments that allow each student to learn, equitable, based on adult learning principles, and open to different learning styles. The interests and needs in these environments are defined together by the learner and the educator. By keeping the experiences of the learner at the forefront, the opportunity is given to learn by doing and supported with feedback.\n\nPreeclampsia is clinically defined as a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or above after the 20th week of pregnancy and the addition of proteinuria (300mg / 24 hours). It can develop in about 5-10% of all pregnancies. It is defined as a nulliparous disease since it is seen in approximately 85% of women during their first pregnancy. Preeclampsia constitutes 15% of the causes of maternal mortality in our country.\n\nIn studies evaluating the effectiveness of simulation training in planning the follow-up and care of preeclampsia, it was determined that this method increases the knowledge and self-confidence of nurses. For example; Christian and Krumwiede's study they found that the self-efficacy rates were significantly higher in the post-simulation test. In his study, Olubumno investigated the importance of simulation in increasing the critical thinking of perinatology nurses in the care of preeclamptic pregnant women, he found that the pre-test and post-test scores increased by 0.75 points, and this difference between the scores is statistically significant. Tabatabaeian et al., In their study comparing the effects of simulation-based education, coeducation and theoretical education on the performance of midwives in preeclampsia and eclampsia, found that the mean of the simulation group was higher than the other two groups.\n\nPreeclampsia is an important obstetric emergency in women's health and disease nursing. Thus, when they start working in the clinic, it is aimed to be able to suspect preeclampsia with the anamnesis they received from the pregnant who applied to them, and to gain them with the simulation method what they should pay attention to and how to do in the follow-up of the pregnant woman hospitalized with the diagnosis of preeclampsia. Studies conducted in our country did not include studies involving students and healthcare professionals in the management of preeclampsia with simulation methods. Therefore, it is aimed to contribute to the literature with this study.",

Intravenous lidocaine has been used for more than 25 years to treat different acute and chronic pain conditions but has not yet been studied for endometriosis pain.\n\nThis is a cross-over trial over two months where one month you will receive the active medication (lidocaine) and one month you will receive the active placebo (diphenhydramine, commonly known as benadryl). We will compare the effect on pain from endometriosis of lidocaine to active placebo.",

Objective: The present clinical study proposes the use of PBS CIMMO DTA\u00ae cement as an indirect pulp capper, in resin restorations composed of permanent molars and premolars. The objective was to minimize postoperative sensitivity arising from restorative procedures. Method: Randomized clinical trial with two arms, double blind, interventional, prospective. The sample consisted of 20 male patients, with an average age of 20 years. Totaling 70 teeth to be treated. The teeth were divided into two groups: Group R (Control Group, n = 35), treated with a standard restorative procedure. Group D (Study group n = 35), treated using CEMENT PBS CIMMO DTA\u00ae, as an indirect capper of the pulp wall. The evaluation was carried out by a masked examiner for both groups. Sensitivity tests were performed before the restorative procedure, at 48 hours, 7, 15 and 30 days after the procedure. The analysis included pain caused by thermal stimuli: Cold Test (TM); horizontal (TPH) and vertical (TPV) percussion; Bite Test (TM) and Pain Decline Time (DD) was measured. Measured using Visual Analog Scale (EVA).",

    "BriefSummary": "Breech presentation occurs in approximately 3-5% of all pregnancies, and breech birth is more complicated and risky for the fetus than births of fetuses in the cephalic position.\n\nTherefore, it is desirable to turn the fetus from breech presentation to cephalic position before labour. This is traditionally done by external cephalic version, where the doctor manually tries to turn the fetus; the success rate of this is approximately 50%, and complications occur in about 0.5%. In addition there is discomfort and pain to the pregnant woman.\n\nThe investigators will assess the effect of using the rebozo prior to the external version. Use of rebozo is a recognized technique from Mexico, where the midwife with a scarf 'shake' the pregnant woman's pelvis over several sessions, so the fetus spontaneously turns to cephalic presentation or the external version is facilitated.\n\nThere are no known complications associated with the rebozo method. Use of rebozo in breech presentation has never before been studied scientifically, but is used in many places in the world. The investigators are planning an open-labeled randomized controlled study in pregnancies with verified breech or transverse presentation: by lot either standard external cephalic version or preceding rebozo-treatment with subsequent external cephalic version.\n\nThe investigators want to assess whether the use of rebozo - either as pre-treatment for external cephalic version or as a catalyst of spontaneous version - will increase the incidence of the cephalic presentations at labour and thus reduce the number of planned caesarean section.\n\nThe population will be pregnant women with ultrasound verified breech or transverse presentation;all women who fulfill the local guideline criteria for external cephalic version, can be included. Exclusion criteria are non-Danish speaking or reading.\n\nThe recruitment will be conducted by midwife at week 35 in the antenatal care. The study design will be open-labeled randomized controlled. Randomisation is done by \"closed envelope method\" and stratified by parity. Intervention is rebozo exercises performed over 3-5 days from randomization. In case of persistent breech presentation, the woman is offered standard external cephalic version. The control group will also be offered external cephalic version after 3-5 days from randomization.\n\nThe investigators will use source data from existing local databases, \"Obstetrics Database\" and \"version Database\", for collecting birth outcome. In all stages of intervention documented electronically by project midwives.\n\nThe primary objective is the number of successful versions in total, i.e., after intervention and external cephalic version. We expect to increase the success rate from 50% to 65%, thus requiring 378 women in the study.\n\nSecondary objectives are the number of successful vaginal births with birth in head position and total number of caesarean.",

Sleep inertia is highly prevalent in various neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative, affective and circadian sleep-wake rhythms disorders, as well as in frequent societal conditions such as chronic sleep restriction, jetlag and shiftwork. Reactive countermeasures against sleep inertia, i.e., strategies implemented upon wake-up, are not sufficiently effective, yet current recommendations are limited to proactive strategies, including long enough sleep at optimal times of day. These recommendations are not always easy and sometimes impossible to apply. To address this unmet medical need, the investigators developed an innovative, time-controlled, pulsatile-release formulation of 160 mg caffeine targeting an efficacious dose briefly before planned awakening.",

    "BriefSummary": "Approximately 400,000 live births occur to adolescents in the United States annually. Of the 50% of adolescent mothers who experience depressive symptoms, less than 25% comply with referrals for depression evaluation and treatment due to lack of knowledge of depression symptoms (literacy), negative attitude towards mental health treatment, perception that individuals with depression are stigmatized (subjective norms), lack of understanding of health resources that are available to her and under her control (perceived control), and lack of time. Social media is a promising vehicle to reach and educate adolescent mothers since most adolescent mothers use social media for communication and to search for health information. Based upon the Theory of Planned Behavior, the investigators will target 11 counties in Kentucky with a social media ad campaign that will result in adolescent mothers (n=140) from those counties enrolling in an internet based intervention related to postpartum depression. The previously tested intervention includes vignettes from other adolescent mothers, questions and answers, resources, and an option to enroll in text message service. Before the intervention, after the intervention, and two weeks later the adolescent mothers will complete established questionnaires to determine if the intervention improved attitude and subjective norms towards depression and depression treatment, perceived control and intention related to seeking depression treatment, and the number of adolescent mothers with symptoms of depression who receive depression treatment. Data will be compared to scores on the same instruments from adolescent mothers (n=140) from the control group (18 other counties in Kentucky) that have not been targeted with the social media ad campaign or participated in the intervention. Data from the adolescent mothers in the control group will be collected in partnership with community agencies. The overall purpose of this trial is to test a cost effective and feasible method for reducing the cognitive and emotional barriers to accessing depression treatment in adolescent mothers. The specific aims are to (1) measure the extent to which a social media ad campaign is effective as a recruitment strategy; (2) test the effectiveness of an internet based social marketing intervention on both intention to seek treatment and rates of depression treatment, and (3) examine the dose effect of the intervention.",

Indications may include: prevention of recurrent prolapse, treatment of pain, and improved sexual function and cosmesis, as well as to treat the sensation of a \"wide vagina.\" Differences in postoperative pain by suturing technique and standard use of suture type are not well established. Patient satisfaction can be influenced by patient perceptions regarding postoperative pain, therefore reducing postoperative pain scores remains a priority. It is unclear whether suturing technique is associated with less pain after this procedure. Based on studies on repair of obstetric lacerations, we hypothesize that a subcuticular skin closure will be associated with less postoperative perineal pain compared to interrupted transcutaneous sutures.",

    "BriefSummary": "There is an ongoing debate regarding how cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening can best be incorporated into current prenatal screening algorithms for chromosomal abnormalities.\n\nTest performance of cfDNA has been shown to be better that first-trimester combined screening (FTCS). However, the cost of the cfDNA testing is considered too high to adopt as first line screening. Moreover, FTCS includes a detailed ultrasound examination of the fetus with nuchal translucency (NT) measurement that allows for early detection of fetal abnormalities.\n\nAn approach in which every woman are offered an early anatomy scan along with cfDNA may also be a reasonable option. Recently a randomized controlled trial, including 1,518 women with singleton pregnancy undergoing first-trimester screening, compared the screening performance of FTCS with an approach that uses the combination of a detailed ultrasound examination and cfDNA analysis. The trial showed that first-trimester risk assessment for trisomy 21 that includes a detailed ultrasound examination along cfDNA was associated with a significant reduction in the false-positive rate compared with FTCS. This approach obviates the need for maternal serum free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A in screening for fetal aneuploidy.\n\nDespite robust evidence on the very high detection rate of cfDNA in detecting trisomy 21, literature is lacking on data regarding women's experience and emotional well-being and satisfaction after test-results of women offered cfDNA compared to those offered FTCS.",

    "BriefSummary": "Climacteric or Menopausal Transition is defined as the time period where there is a change to non-reproductive reproductive life, with extension of variable length. During this period, and after the establishment of Menopause and non-functioning ovarian, the appearance of various symptoms that express the depletion of ovarian follicles is common; among these symptoms, the most frequently reported by women are vasomotor symptoms or hot flashes. In addition to hormonal therapy, other medications have been employed in an attempt to improve these symptoms; although they present better results than placebo, yet have little clinical impact in reducing vasomotor symptoms. Therefore, this gap allows the evaluation of alternative therapies, such as Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). The rationale for studying the effect of this technique in this context is its possible autonomic modulatory effect. What reinforces the choice of this technique is the fact that it demonstrated efficacy in other pathologies such as depression, pain, Parkinson's disease, among others. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a renewed method of non-invasive brain modulation. It is based on a transcranial application of weak direct currents in a non-invasive, simple and painless manner. Its use in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms has not been studied. The objective of this study is to evaluate the improvement of vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women, after application of tDCS, and compare them to a control group. This Randomized Clinical Trial will be held in female postmenopausal patients, followed in the outpatient Menopause Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology Service, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre. From these results, it is expected to present a new therapeutic option in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms.",

Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to 4 Cohorts of 6 subjects each to receive active drug (PUR 0110 Enema) or placebo enema as follows: 187.5 mg/60 g - Cohort 1, 375 mg/60 g - Cohort 2, 750 mg/60 g - Cohort 3 or 1500 mg/60 g - Cohort 4. Within each Cohort, subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either active treatment (PUR 0110 enema; n = 4) or placebo enema (n = 2). Each subject will receive only 1 dose of assigned study medication and dosing of subjects within each cohort will also be by sequential inclusion.",

    "BriefSummary": "This study has two phases. Phase 1 will examine the role of inflammatory mediators called cytokines on growth hormone levels in women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Phase 2 will evaluate the effect of etanercept on these growth hormone levels. Etanercept is approved for the treatment of RA. It lowers the levels of a key inflammatory mediator called tumor necrosis factor-alpha and is very effective in reducing arthritis symptoms.\n\nGrowth hormone promotes bone and muscle growth. With aging, people lose muscle mass and bone strength, possibly because of decreased levels of growth hormone. People with RA have bone and muscle changes similar to those in older people, perhaps also due to decreased levels of growth hormone. The first part of this study will see if the inflammatory mediators responsible for joint inflammation (warmth, redness, pain, and swelling) in RA are related to the lowered growth hormone levels in this disease. The second part will evaluate the effect of etanercept treatment on muscle mass and bone density, in addition to growth hormone levels.\n\nPremenopausal women between 18 and 55 years of age with a recent diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (less than 3 years) are eligible for this study. Healthy volunteers will also be enrolled in the first phase of the study as control subjects. This study is conducted at two sites, the NIH and the Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore.\n\nHealthy volunteers enrolled in this study will be interviewed about their health status and will fill out questionnaires on diet and general physical function, including fatigue, energy and well being. In addition, they will be hospitalized once at the NIH Clinical Center for 24-hour blood sampling and will visit to Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore for a brachial artery reactivity study, as follows:\n\n* 24-hour blood sampling for growth hormone levels. Blood samples (1/2 teaspoon each) will be collected every 20 minutes from 8 AM one day until 8 AM the following day through a plastic tube in an arm vein.\n* Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan on a small area of the spine, hip and wrist to assess bone density and a total body DEXA scan to assess the amount and distribution of muscle and body fat.\n* Blood vessel (brachial artery reactivity) study to measure the ability of the brachial artery to dilate and increase its blood flow. For this procedure, the subject lies on a table with electrocardiogram leads attached to the chest. A blood pressure cuff is inflated for several minutes and a drop of nasal spray of nitroglycerin is given that may cause a headache. Blood pressure and headache are monitored and treated as needed.\n\nPatients with rheumatoid arthritis will be seen at the NIH clinic on six separate visits (weeks 0, 1, 6, 12, 18, and 26) over 26 weeks. Week 0 is a screening visit. At weeks 1 and 26, patients will be admitted to the hospital for 24-hour blood sampling, DEXA scans, and brachial artery reactivity tests, as described above, plus X-rays of the hand and feet. After the first visit, they will start taking etanercept, given by self-injection under the skin (like insulin shots) twice a week. Follow-up visits at weeks 6, 12, and 18 will involve evaluations of disease activity and drug side effects through joint examination, blood tests, and questionnaires.",

Although effective tools for prevention and control of malaria exist, their delivery presents a problem. Intermittent presumptive treatment (IPT) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is effective, yet \\>60% of women in Uganda do not get it as \\< 40%, attend antenatal care. Effective ways of delivering IPT with SP to pregnant women at a community level need to be developed. This study assessed whether community based resource persons like traditional birth attendants (TBAs), community reproductive health workers (CRHWs), adolescent peer mobilizers (APMs) and drug-shop owners (DSV) can distribute IPT with SP to pregnant women.\n\nObjectives: The objectives of this study were:\n\n* To assess community based approaches for delivering malaria prevention to pregnant women in Uganda;\n* To assess community perceptions, beliefs and practices associated with malaria treatment and prevention in pregnancy;\n* To assess whether community based resource persons can deliver IPT to pregnant women and reach those most at risk;\n* To assess the impact of IPT on anaemia and pregnancy outcome;\n* To estimate cost-effectiveness of the approaches and assess the acceptability and sustainability of the approaches.\n\nMethods: The study was conducted in 5 sub-counties of the Mukono district, situated on the shores of L. Victoria in Central Uganda. The district is hyper-endemic for malaria. 25 parishes with a total population of 75,000 people were used to test the new approaches. Phase 1 obtained qualitative data on community perceptions, beliefs and practices associated with malaria prevention in pregnancy. Phase 2 was an intervention study that assessed distribution of IPT to pregnant women by TBAs, CRHWs, APMs and DSVs compared with health units. Pregnant women of all parities were enrolled. Key resource persons in each parish were identified to sensitise the communities on the intervention. Data was collected regarding: timing of the first dose of SP, proportion of women who complete two doses of SP, birth weight of babies, proportion of low birth-weight babies, and proportion of adolescent pregnancies. The third phase of the study evaluated the sustainability of the approaches.\n\nWork Plan: The first phase of the study took two months. The second phase took 14-16 months. Data analysis was expected to take 12 months.",

    "BriefSummary": "Autoregulation is the ability of a vascular bed to maintain blood flow despite changes in perfusion pressure. For a long time it had been assumed that the choroid is a strictly passive vascular bed, which shows no autoregulation. However, recently several groups have identified some autoregulatory capacity of the human choroid. In the brain and the retina the mechanism behind autoregulation is most likely linked to changes in transmural pressure. In this model arterioles change their vascular tone depending on the pressure inside the vessel and outside the vessel. In the choroid, several observations argue against a direct involvement of arterioles. However, the mechanism behind choroidal autoregulation remains unclear.\n\nIn the present study autoregulation of the choroid will be investigated during a decrease in ocular perfusion pressure, which will be achieved by an increase in intraocular pressure. Pressure/flow relationships will be investigated in the absence or presence of a NO synthase inhibitor. As a control substance the alpha-receptor agonist phenylephrine will be used.",

For enhancing their muscle power, athletes comprise several resistance training programs as part of their training. However, muscle power training comprises of eccentric muscle actions, which, especially when unaccustomed, can lead to exercise-induced muscle damage and deterioration of muscle performance. Nevertheless, despite the fact that muscle power training comprises eccentric muscle actions, and consequently can lead to muscle injury and muscle performance reduction during the following days, the recovery kinetics after acute muscle power training have not been adequately studied. However, information regarding the recovery of the muscles after a power training protocol, is critical for the correct design of a training microcycle, and the reduction of injury risk. The aim of the present study is to investigate the muscle injury provoked after acute muscle power training using three different power training exercise protocols. Additionally, the effect of these protocols on muscle performance and neuromuscular fatigue indices will be examined.",

    "BriefSummary": "Muscle size declines at around 0.5-1% per year after 50 years of age, with muscle strength declining up to twice as fast as muscle size. This may eventually lead to loss of independence if tasks of daily living become too strenuous to be performed safely. Short periods of bed rest cause very rapid loss of muscle size and strength, and studies using healthy older participants have shown that age increases vulnerability to this muscle loss. However, it is unlikely that healthy individuals would be faced with periods of bed rest unless suffering a severe illness. In light of this, recent evidence has shown that even just reducing walking to less than 1,500 steps per day for two weeks caused 4% loss of leg muscle in over 65 year olds. This amount of activity is roughly the equivalent of being housebound, something that may become more common into older age, for example due to prolonged bad weather, or minor injury or illness.\n\nThis study will investigate what causes such stark muscle loss during two weeks of reduced activity, and the impact on skeletal muscle function and size, as well as balance, body composition, and other indicators of general health such as how the body responds to food or exercise. Importantly, exercise strategies that could reduce muscle loss during a period of reduced activity will also be investigated.\n\nIn brief, three groups of 10 older men (aged 65-80 years) will undertake two weeks of reduced physical activity by limiting their daily steps to \\<1,500/day. All groups will then undertake a re-training exercise programme to ensure that any losses in muscle strength or size are regained. One of the groups will be a control, whereby they will undertake the step-reduction intervention and re-training, but no protective exercise before or during the step-reduction intervention. This group will allow us to achieve our primary objective of determining the influence of two weeks of reduced physical activity on muscle strength and size in healthy older males. The two other groups will undertake either four weeks of strength exercise training before the step-reduction intervention, or daily home based exercise 'snacking' during the step-reduction intervention. The potential protective benefits of the exercise interventions in reducing the impact of two weeks of reduced activity on muscle strength and size, and any effect on how muscle is re-gained afterwards, will be compared to the 'control' group.",

However, several aspects need to be considered.\n\nThe aim of this project is to evaluate fast-track discharge for multiparas after elective CS concerning neonatal and maternal complications as well as the parents' sense of security and well-being.\n\nThe study is a randomized controlled trial including 142 women allocated to either 1) the intention to discharge within 28 hours followed by a home visit or 2) standard discharge after at least 48 hours after elective CS.\n\nThis study will be among the first evaluating fast-track discharge after CS in a European context. If a positive outcome is achieved, we expect that fast-track discharge can be implemented with improved quality and reduced costs in postnatal care following elective CS.",

This receptor may also interfere with glucose metabolism and insulin action. The purpose of this study is to compare an atypical antipsychotic drugs, olanzapine, which acts by occupying the 5HT2A receptor, to another antipsychotic drug, amisulpride, which mainly acts through the dopamine pathway. Healthy volunteers are recruited and asked to take a single dose of each drug and of placebo on separate days. Then, a combined glucose clamp study will be performed in order to test the effects of these drugs on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.",

Current efforts to prevent dyslipidemia and lipids alteration include the development of functional products as an alternative for the management of hypertriglyceridemia. Common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are a recognized good source of bioactive compounds, mainly phenolic compounds, total dietary fiber (insoluble and soluble fiber, resistant starch and oligosaccharides), saponins, and phytosterols that exert hypolipidemic effects. In this sense, the development of beans-based food products is an alternative for improving the general health status. In previous work, a beans-oats snack bar formulation was found to be a promising potential functional product. In order to validate those results, the aim of this works was to assess a clinical trial was conducted with Mexican women to assess the effect of daily consumption of the functional product on serum triglycerides and certain plasma proteins involved in lipids metabolism in a clinical trial. The clinical trial was 2 months, randomized parallel study where 32 women with elevated triglycerides were randomized into the treatment group and control group. The Control group received nutritional orientation whereas the treatment group received the orientation and consumed 50 g of the product per day. Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline and the end of the study, obtaining serum and plasma for analysis of lipids profile, glucose, and biomarkers. To determine changes in plasma proteins, a 182 protein Human Obesity Antibody Array was used, and the results were analyzed using a bioinformatic-based analysis from Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (QIAGEN)",

    "BriefSummary": "There are currently several points concerning rTMS for pain relief that have a huge impact in the practical application of rTMS in clinical practice, but which have not been approached by previous studies. Also, an even more important issue is the frequency of the sessions in each treatment protocol. The idea of performing stimulation in chronic pain patients on a consecutive daily basis for long-term treatments seem unrealistic and potentially costly. However, it has been reported in animals, healthy subjects and FM patients that the analgesic effects of rTMS can outlast the stimulation session for several minutes and even days. This has led to the proposal that pain treatment with rTMS could be performed in consecutive daily induction sessions, followed by spaced (weekly, fortnightly and even monthly) maintenance sessions. This approach is similar to what is performed routinely in patients with major depression treated by rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and has successfully been tested in FM patients in a single- center study. Should this approach prove effective in larger prospective multicentric studies, rTMS could enter the armamentarium of non-invasive, non- pharmacological, low-adverse event therapeutic options to relieve fibromyalgia- related pain and associate symptoms. Hence, our aim is to conduct a multicentric international clinical trial on the influence of rTMS in the control of pain in a consecutive adaptive trial design where conventional rTMS (10Hz) and patterned rTMS (theta-burst) will be studied. Stimulations will be performed in a clinical practice-friendly approach, where daily maintenance sessions will be followed by weekly, and fortnightly stimulation sessions. There have been very scarce adaptive trials in the pain and non-invasive stimulation fields. This methodological approach allows for the use of lower number of patients in consecutive trials and, among other qualities, it allows for the imputation of data from the first trial into the second one, thus decreasing the duration of the studies and the number of participants.",

Breast surgery was identified as a strong risk factor for PONV. According to the previous studies, the incidence of PONV is 30-70% in patients undergoing the breast cancer surgery, which not only gives patients unpleasant and painful experience, but also prolongs the hospital stays and delay patient discharge and adds to hospital costs. We compared the effects of dexamethasone alone vs. in combination with Pericardium 6 (P6) electrical stimulation or granisetron for inhibition of PONV in women undergoing breast cancer surgery.",

These effects may be mediated by cAMP/PKA dependent activation of several downstream sites that modulate protein synthesis and breakdown. While the role of beta2-adrenoceptor signaling is well-described in animals, it is inadequately explored in humans. The purpose of the study is thus to investigate the effect of chronic beta2-adrenergic stimulation (cAMP/PKA-signaling) on muscle hypertrophy.",

    "BriefSummary": "In the 19th century, researchers found out that the differences in the energy content of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrate and fat) can elicit different responses in the amount of calories individuals burn per day. It was demonstrated that protein has a metabolic advantage when compared to the other macronutrients (carbohydrate and fat). Since these findings, researchers all over the world started to study how diets differing in macronutrient distribution could result in different responses to energy metabolism. Diets with high amounts of protein (i.e. meats, eggs, dairy products, and grains) are becoming more popular, and studies have shown that when people eat high quantities of protein they lose weight and fat mass, maintain the weight loss, and burn more calories per day.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that giving high amounts of protein to healthy women will increase the amount of calories and fat they burn per day, increase their satiety, and improve health markers when compared to a normal diet. The increased protein level will be achieved using a nutrition supplement consisted of soy protein, yogurt and honey.\n\nTo test this, the investigators plan to divide the participants in two groups: one will eat a normal diet and the other a diet with high amounts of protein during one and a half day. After one month they will change groups and eat the other diet for the same period of time. During this period consuming the diets (1.5 days), participants will stay inside a whole body calorimetry suite, which is similar to a hotel bedroom and is able to inform in the most precise way the amount of calories participants will burn and if they are burning more fat. Additionally, before and after each meal participants will have to answer a questionnaire about their appetite sensations and blood will also be collected to analyze health markers.",

However, the type of protein appears to play a role in satiety possibly due to the different balance of the amino acid profile.\n\nThe research project is dedicated to identify the source (animal or plant) and the optimized protein quantity needed to accelerate satiation, suppress appetite and extend satiety until hunger appears again.\n\nIt is hypothesized that the consumption of animal derived protein-enriched meals will induce a reduction in hunger through the impact on gut hormones and peptides that are closely related to the short-term regulation of food intake.",

The programmed intermittent epidural bolus (PIEB) technique has been shown to produce less consumption of local anesthetics, better sensory block, less motor block, and increased maternal satisfaction than other epidural analgesia techniques. Despite all benefits from PIEB, such practice has been associated with high sensory block levels. Therefore, assessment of the sensory block level is an essential component of clinical safety. The lack of a standardized technique and timing to assess the sensory block level can lead to inappropriate management. The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes in block level over time, during cycles of a PIEB regimen. The investigators hypothesize that these levels will be highest soon after the PIEB bolus and lowest preceding the subsequent PIEB bolus. The investigators also want to investigate a possible correlation between these changes in sensory block levels and motor block, pain scores, and rescue bolus of local anesthetics.",

The female individuals were randomly divided into the TRE or ERD groups in an unbiased manner using a computer-generated block randomisation list. Individuals in the TRE group applied a diet limited to 8 hours for 8 weeks (16/8). They were fed ad libitum between 10.00 a.m-06.00 p.m and fasted between 06.00 p.m-10.00 a.m.No restrictions were imposed on the type and amount of food consumed during the feeding period. During the fasting period, individuals consumed water and non-energy drinks (tea, coffee, soda, etc.). Individuals in the ERD group followed a diet specially prepared for them for 8 weeks. At the first encounter with individuals, resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured by the indirect calorimetry method. Physical Activity Level (PAL) was determined by physical activity record. The total energy expenditure (TEE) of individuals was determined using the 'REE x PAL' formulation. 'TEE-500 kcal' formulation was used for the diet to be given to individuals. Individuals were not given a diet containing energy below the REE. Acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR) were taken as dietary content. The diet given to individuals has 45-65% carbohydrate, 20-35% fat, 10-35% protein content. Nutritional habits of individuals were taken into consideration while planning the diet. Each individual consumed 3 main meals and the number of snacks was determined individually. Food exchange lists were given to individuals and nutrient changes were explained in detail. Anthropometric and body composition measurements of individuals were taken. The energy expenditure was measured using indirect calorimetry. Blood pressure and heart rate measurements were made. Biochemical parameters were evaluated and food consumption were taken. The quality of dietary intake was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) -2015.",

    "BriefSummary": "During the continuing SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, several studies have reported a significant difference in the rate of severe cases between adult females and adult males (42% vs 58%). Among children under the age of 14, the rate of severe cases was reported to be extremely low. To explain this difference, several theories have been proposed including cigarette smoking and lifestyle habits. However, no theory fits both the gender difference in severe cases as well as reduced risk in pre-pubescent children. Our past research on male androgenetic alopecia (AGA) has led us to investigate an association between androgens and COVID-19 pathogenesis. In normal subjects, androgen expression demonstrates significant variation between men and women as well as between adults and pre-pubescent children.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 primarily infects type II pneumocytes in the human lung. SARS-CoV-2 enters pneumocytes, by anchoring to the ACE2 cell surface receptor. Prior to receptor binding, viral spike proteins undergo proteolytic priming by the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). TMPRSS2 inhibition or knock down reduces ability of SARS-CoV-1 (a related virus to SARS-CoV-2) to infect cells in vitro. Additionally, TMPRSS2 also facilitates entry of influenza A and influenza B into primary human airway cells and type II pneumocytes.\n\nThe human TMPRSS2 gene has a 15 bp androgen response element and in humans, androgens are the only known transcription promoters for the TMPRSS2 gene. In a study of androgen-stimulated prostate cancer cells (LNCaP), TMPRSS2 mRNA expression increase was mediated by the androgen receptor.10 Further, the ACE2 receptor, also critical for SARS-CoV-2 viral infectivity, is affected by male sex hormones with higher activity found in males.\n\nAndrogenetic alopecia (AGA), often referred to as male pattern hair loss, is the most common form of hair loss among men. The development of androgenetic alopecia is androgen mediated and is dependent on genetic variants found in the androgen receptor gene located on the X chromosome. We hypothesized that men with AGA would be more prone to severe COVID-19 disease. We conducted a preliminary observational study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at two Spanish tertiary hospitals between March 23-April 6, 2020 to test this theory. In total, 41 Caucasian males admitted to the hospitals with a diagnosis of bilateral SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were analyzed. The mean age of patients was 58 years (range 23-79). Among them, 29 (71%) were diagnosed with AGA (16 (39%) were classified as severe AGA (Hamilton IV or above)) and 12 (29%) did not present clinical signs of AGA. The diagnosis of AGA was performed clinically by a dermatologist. The precise prevalence of AGA among otherwise healthy Spanish Caucasian males is unknown; however, based on published literature, the expected prevalence of a similar age-matched Caucasian population is approximately 31-53%.\n\nFurther, according to the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-rapid-risk-assessment-coronavirus-disease-2019-eighth-update-8-april-2020.pdf): \"Of the confirmed cases in China, 3.8% (1 716/44 672) were healthcare workers. Of those, 14.8% were severely or critically ill and 5% of the severe cases died. Latest figures reported from Italy show that 9% of COVID-19 cases are healthcare workers, with Lombardy region reporting up to 20% of cases in healthcare workers. In Spain, the latest COVID-19 situation overview from the Ministry of Health reports that 26% of COVID-19 cases are in healthcare workers. In a Dutch study, healthcare workers were tested voluntarily for COVID-19 and 6% tested positive. In a report on 30 cases in healthcare workers in China, all cases had a history of direct contact (distance within 1 metre) with COVID-19 patients, with an average number of 12 contacts, and the average cumulative contact time being two hours (1.5, 2.7). In the Dutch study, only 3% of the healthcare workers reported being exposed to hospital patients with COVID-19 prior onset of symptoms and 63% had worked while asymptomatic.\n\nBased on the scientific rationale combined with this preliminary observation, we propose to test an anti-androgen as a treatment for patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19. This study is intended to explore the possible protective role of anti-androgens in SARS-CoV-2 infection, including reduction of virological duration and disease severity.",

    "BriefSummary": "Background\n\nThe negative effects of perinatal depression on mother and child start early and persist throughout the life-course. Given that 10-35% of children worldwide are exposed to perinatal depression in their first year of life, 16 mitigating this intergenerational risk is a global public health priority. However, there is a dearth of studies on whether a maternal depression intervention can have long-term benefits for either the mother or her child. This is a study of the effectiveness of an extended 36-month peer-delivered depression intervention, the Thinking Healthy Programme PLUS (THPP+) for women and their children in rural Pakistan.\n\nStudy Design\n\nThe THPP+ study aims to evaluate the effects of an extended 36-month perinatal depression intervention on mother and child outcomes using a cluster randomized controlled trial (c-RCT) design. The trial will recruit 560 pregnant women who screened positive for perinatal depression (PHQ-9 \\>=10) from 40 village clusters, of which 20 clusters will receive the THPP+ intervention delivered by trained peers. These women will have already been participating in the trial of the shorter, 6 month long, version of the intervention. Women in the THPP+ intervention arm will receive bimonthly group-based sessions. Primary outcomes are 3-year maternal depression and 3-year child socio-emotional and cognitive development. All primary analyses will be intention-to-treat and will account for the clustered study design.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis trial has the potential to further significantly our understanding of whether intervening on women's perinatal depression can mitigate the negative effects of maternal depression on 36-month child development.",

Paclitaxel (currently marketed as Taxol) is an anti-microtubular network agent and is active in a broad spectrum of malignancies. Paclitaxel has poor solubility. In order to enhance the solubility, this drug is formulated with polyoxyethylated castor oil, which leading to infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions. The NeoPharm LEP-ETU is formulated with a mixture of well characterized, synthetic phospholipids and cholesterol. This design eliminates the need for the oil. The LEP-ETU formulation has improved safety profile that is necessary for administering higher doses than would commonly be used with Taxol. The clinical evidence obtained from the NeoPharm Phase I study shows LEP-ETU is better tolerated than Taxol, as indicated by a higher maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). The current Phase II study is designed to accomplish the following objectives:\n\n1. Assess the Overall Response Rate (ORR) of patients with metastatic breast cancer after administered over 90 minutes at the dose of 275 mg/m2 LEP-ETU\n2. To evaluate the Progression-Free Survival (PFS)\n3. To evaluate the safety of LEP-ETU at 275 mg/m2 level, in particular peripheral neuropathy\n4. To evaluate the Overall Survival (OS)",

To evaluate a passive industrial exoskeleton for back support, a protocol was developed in which individual production operations will be modeled.\n\nThis research will recruit 9 valunteers. During a 4-hour laboratory visit, each subject will perform three identical experimental tests: one test without an exoskeleton and two tests using two different modifications of the exoskeleton prototype. To avoid sequence bias, the test order will be randomized (balanced). Two types of labor operations will be simulated. One operation will consist in lifting the load, which is 20% of the volunteer's body weight, from a height of 14 cm to a surface with a height of 70 cm, the frequency of lifting is 1 time in 30 seconds. The second operation is holding a cargo weighing 5 kg in a forced working position (tilt of the body more than 30 \u00b0) for 1 minute, after which rest will follow for 1 minute, and then the work will be repeated. Both types of work will be performed for 105 minutes, then a break of 15 minutes, then 105 minutes of work. Heart rate, blood pressure, ECG (Custo) will be monitored. An ergospirometric device (Metamax) will be used to collect muscle activity data (Trust-M, Myoton), inertial sensors (Trust-M) will be used to evaluate the biomechanics of movements. In addition, questionnaires will be filled out for a subjective assessment of the use of exoskeleton prototypes (local discomfort scale, exoskeleton properties assessment questionnaire).",

    "BriefSummary": "Multimodal pain management program is needed to control severe pain after abdominal hysterectomy which is considered as one of the major abdominal surgeries. Opioids (which are the analgesic of choice) have many adverse effects such as sedation, nausea, and vomiting. Hence, different methods are needed to control pain and decrease opioid consumption and its side effects.\n\nTransversus abdominis plane (TAP) block blocks the sensory afferent nerves run between the abdominal muscles and controls postoperative incisional pain.\n\nBlanco was the first who described the quadratus lumborum block (QLB). Somatic pain after upper and lower abdominal surgery can be controlled by QLB. QLB can be performed for all generations (adult, pediatrics, and pregnant).\n\nQLB is considered to be an easy technique to learn as it is easy to get the key sonoanatomic markers for QLB. The novice can learn this block after only a few performance of the procedure. QLB produces effective postoperative analgesia after abdominal surgery, laparoscopic surgery, anterior abdominal wall surgery, and hip and femur surgery. The analgesic effect of QLB covers 24-48 h. While some authors inserted catheter for continuous infusion of the local anesthetic drug to extend the duration of postoperative analgesia, others added dexamethasone to local anesthetic to extend the effect of local anesthetic drugs.\n\nUltrasound (US)-guided Ilioinguinal and Iliohypogastric nerve and TAP block have been established as analgesic adjuncts for post hernia repair pain management, under general anaesthesia, neuraxial, MAC and infiltration techniques.\n\nUS-guided technique of blocking Ilioinguinal and Iliohypogastric nerves have higher success rate compared to conventional technique. TAP block provides analgesia to the parietal peritoneum and skin of the abdomen in infra-umbilical surgeries. Few cadaveric studies showed good analgesic effect in the region between T10 and L1 following a single posterior TAP injection.",

    "BriefSummary": "Currently, there is no consensus regarding iron supplementation dose that is most beneficial for maternal and offspring health during gestation. This deficit, or excess, of iron prejudices the mother-child wellbeing. Therefore the hypotheses are that an iron supplementation adapted to values of hemoglobin at the start of the pregnancy will would be more effective in preventing iron deficiency, without increasing the risk of hemoconcentration by the end of pregnancy. This would be helped optimize mother-child health status.\n\nThe aims of the study are to determine the highest level of effectiveness of iron supplementation adapted to hemoglobin (Hb) levels in early pregnancy, which would be optimum for mother-child health.\n\nTo accomplish this objective a Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) triple-blinded was designed. The study is structured as a RCT with 2 strata, depending on the Hb levels before week 12 of gestation.\n\nStratum 1: If Hb from 110 to 130 g/L, randomly assigned at week 12 to receive iron supplement of 40 or 80 mg/d.\n\nStratum 2: If Hb \\>130 g/L, randomly assigned at week 12 to receive iron supplement of 40 or 20 mg/d.\n\nThis study will be conducted in non-anemic pregnant women at early gestation stage, and their subsequent newborns. The data recollected to mothers will be: socio-economic data, clinical history, food item frequency, lifestyle and emotional state, and adherence to iron supplement prescription. In addition, biochemical measured will be Hemoglobin, serum ferritin, C reactive protein, cortisol, and alterations in the HFE gene (C282Y, H63D). In children, the data collected will be: ultrasound fetal biometry, anthropometric measurements, and temperament development\n\nShould conclusive outcomes be reached, the study would indicate the optimal iron supplementation dose required to promote maternal and infant health. These results would contribute towards developing guidelines for good clinical practice.",

Every two years, the local cancer screening department sends a personalized invitation mail to eligible women to perform a mammogram and a breast clinical examination. One to two reminder mails are sent to women who have not done the screening after an initial invitation. Despite this programme, almost 47% of women in France do not participate to organized breast cancer screening.\n\nThe Short Message Service (SMS) is an innovative communication tool in the field of health, immediate, reliable delivery, low cost and ecological. The use of SMS could be an innovative, low-cost, personalized and ecological way to support the OBCS invitation strategy.\n\nThe overall objective of this study is to preserve or even better increase participation in organized breast cancer screening while decreasing the associated costs by including SMS in our screening invitation procedure.\n\nTwo SMS interventions will be tested which will correspond to different phases of the OBCS invitation procedure. This sequence of interventions leads us to perform three interlinked trials: a trial of superiority for the first phase (intervention 1: sending an SMS a few days before the initial mail invitation), then two non-inferiority trials for the second phase ( two trials=one for each context of phase 1 _ intervention 2: sending an SMS in place of the first postal reminder).",

The aim of the study was to determine whether there is a difference between the effects of creatine supplementation taken together with Wingate-based HIIT on anaerobic power, leg strength, heart rate variability and body composition. In the study, Wingate-based HIIT program was applied three days a week for six weeks. Anaerobic power (Wingate anaerobic power test), heart rate variability (Polar H10 chest band), leg strength (back and leg dynamometer) and body composition (PlusAvis 333) measurements of the participants were made 1 week before the training program started and the week after the training program ended. Twenty physically active adult men aged 18-30 were voluntarily included for the study. Participants were divided into two groups: Wingate-based HIIT with creatine supplementation (K-HIIT) and Wingate-based HIIT only (HIIT). As a result of the analysis, it was seen that creatine supplementation taken together with wingate-based HIIT had an effect and increased on the anaerobic power parameters, peak power, average power and minimum power values, and leg strength. In addition, it was determined that heart rate variability parameters improved heart rate (HR, beat/min) and low frequency (LF, ms2) values, but did not cause any change in body composition. Comparing and investigating the effects of different HIIT methods on anaerobic power, leg strength, heart rate variability and body composition will increase the generalizability of the study.",

Women are 4 times more likely to have osteoporosis than men because there is no estrogen protection after menopause and women in general have lighter and thinner bones. Recent studies have indicated tocotrienols (one kind of vitamin E) supplement may be good for the bone health in postmenopausal women. However, no study has ever been done the role of tocotrienols in bone health in postmenopausal women. Our long-term goal is to develop a new strategy featuring a dietary supplement (i.e., tocotrienols) for slowing down bone loss in postmenopausal women. The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of 12-week tocotrienols on bone measurements in postmenopausal women. Investigators plan to recruit postmenopausal women using flyers, non-solicited e-mail system, campus announcement, local radio, newspapers, and TV scripts. We plan to enroll approximately 200 women to obtain 78 qualified women at the start of the study. After screening, qualified participants will be matched by body weight and age, and then randomly assigned to no tocotrienols, low tocotrienols, or high tocotrienols group. The outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, after 6, and after 12 weeks. Bone-related measurements will be recorded using blood and urine samples. Investigators will monitor safety of subjects after 6 and after 12 weeks. Food intake, physical activity, and quality of life will be assessed at baseline and 12 weeks.

This would allow more people to be treated and free up money for other important work in the fight against HIV such as education and prevention programs.\n\nHowever, it is not known whether 400mg of Efavirenz works as well as 600mg of Efavirenz during pregnancy and this is why the investigators are conducting this study, which aims to measure the amount of Efavirenz 400mg in HIV pregnant women's bodies when they are taking 400mg of Efavirenz once a day.",

The most frequent complaint is that of itchiness of the vulva but pain may also occur. Some women will experience no symptoms at all. However, it is important to treat this condition since it may increase and cause important scarring and deformity. In less than 5% of cases, cancer may develop.\n\nLichen Sclerosus is a chronic disease which can be controlled but not cured. Topical corticosteroids are the usual treatment for this condition. Though this treatment is generally well tolerated, some patients may not present a sufficient response or may develop mainly local and rarely systemic side effects. In this perspective, an alternative treatment would be beneficial.\n\nTacrolimus, a topical immunomodulator has been approved for the treatment of atopic eczema and has shown its efficacy in the treatment of vulvar lichen sclerosus in a limited number of patients. Tacrolimus acts as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAI) without causing the usual side effects seen with the prolonged use of topical corticosteroids.\n\nThis study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tacrolimus in treating vulvar lichen sclerosus by comparing it with the standard topical corticosteroid treatment.",

A poor posture can increase the number of punctures, patient discomfort, and risk of complications. An adequate position reverses lumbar lordosis, facilitating the access to the intervertebral space. In most cases, insertion of the epidural analgesia catheter is performed in sitting position or in lateral decubitus, the choice being generally guided by the preference of the anesthetist.\n\nAccording to anesthetists' experience in the obstetrical anesthesia unit at Necker-Enfants Malades hospital, a cross-legged sitting position is comfortable for parturients, restricts interfering movements during the procedure, and provides adequate widening of interspinous spaces. This position results in knees and hips flexion, tilting the pelvis backward and opening the interspinous spaces, while limiting muscular strain to maintain the position. However, literature on this matter is scarce.\n\nThe aim of this study is to prove the superiority of the cross-legged position for successful placement of the epidural analgesia catheter at the first puncture without needle reorientation compared to a traditional sitting position on the edge of the bed.",

Exercise can help to manage these side effects, however, less than 30% of this population takes part in regular exercise. The objective of this trial is to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a novel exercise and education program for women with breast cancer during chemotherapy.\n\nMETHODS:\n\nParticipants in this study include women with a diagnosis of stage 1 - 3 breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Women will be divided into three groups. The first group will include 8 sessions of exercise and self-management education during their chemotherapy treatment. The second group will receive self-management education only, and the third group will receive usual care. Outcomes will be compared between groups at baseline, post-intervention, and at 6- and 12- month follow up. Outcomes to be assessed include exercise level, functional mobility, muscle strength, quality of life, health status, and use of health care services.\n\nEXPECTED OUTCOMES:\n\nWomen with breast cancer are among the least active segment of the Canadian population. It is well known that inactivity can lead to physical and psychological side effects, cancer recurrence, and an increase in comorbid conditions. This proposed project addresses a long-standing need to help women with breast cancer become and stay more active by implementing a novel exercise and education program.",

The goal is to compare the effects of two home physical exercise protocols on quality of life and physical fitness of elderly people with breast cancer who are in hormone use. A study was carried out at the Institute of Integral Medicine Professor Fernando Figueira (IMIP) within the Professional Master Program in Palliative Care Associated with the Residency Program in Health, which evaluated the effectiveness of a protocol of 29 exercises with walking sessions, performed at home , In the quality of life and physical fitness of the elderly in the treatment of breast cancer. The results of the mentioned research showed that the elderly showed improvement both in quality of life and physical fitness.\n\nIn view of the results and the clinical and functional kinetic observation of these patients, the hypothesis was that a shorter intervention protocol, with fewer exercises with fewer repetitions and a lower degree of difficulty can bring results similar to those found, requiring a shorter time In the accomplishment of the exercises, which can favor the adherence to the protocol by the patients, still achieving positive results in their quality of life and physical fitness.\n\nThe elderly will undergo evaluations to characterize the sample through questionnaires, the physical fitness assessment will be performed through the Senior Fitness Test (SFT) and anthropometric evaluation before (beginning of the research), in the 6th week and after the 12th week of the research. It will be offered the elderly, instructional material developed for this research - printed manual. It will consist of a routine of 12 exercises to be performed autonomously for range of motion and muscular fitness, using the environmental resources of the home. All control and training guidelines for using the manual will be offered through an introductory lecture and subsequent weekly telephone contacts (twice a week).

The second, long-term overtraining, is characterized by a series of signs and symptoms of exhaustion and persistent fatigue that take place at the level of the central nervous system and that are produced by the imbalance between demanding physical work and recovery periods.This type of condition is also known as, general syndrome of overtraining (GSO), unexplained low performance syndrome, staleness or burnout, which is propitiated by the need to achieve maximum physical performance and the performance of physical activities in a uncontrolled that cause an interruption to the processes of biological recovery that attenuate the obtaining of the physical form wished, reason why the sportsman experiences a decrease of the physical and mental performance, manifested in a clinical picture that reflects muscular inflammation, headache, elevation sudden blood pressure, loss of functional capacity, alterations of the central nervous system (CNS), metabolic, endocrine and immune systems.\n\nThe stretching is commonly used as a method of physical rehabilitation.

This explains the high growth in recent decades of studies investigating the effect of stretching, mainly static and dynamic, when performed immediately before activities that aim to develop these physical capacities. Despite the growing interest of scholars on this topic, the long-term impact of dynamic stretching on flexibility, strength performance, endurance and muscle power is still not fully understood. In addition, a type of dynamic stretching little explored in the literature needs investigation: the stretches used during Pilates exercise sessions. The effects of these stretching exercises on a physical conditioning program based on Pilates exercises in the young adult population are not yet known. Objective: To verify through a randomized clinical trial the effects of stretching in a conditioning program based on Pilates exercises on flexibility, strength, endurance and muscle power. Methods: In this study, 32 young adults of both sexes will be randomized into two groups: 1) Traditional Pilates; 2) Pilates Without Stretching. The Traditional Pilates group will perform a protocol of stretching exercises followed by muscle strengthening. The Pilates Without Stretching group will perform an exercise protocol consisting only of muscle strengthening exercises. Muscle strength results will be evaluated by 1 repetition max by elastic resistance; trunk muscle strength/endurance by the 1-minute abdominal test and the Sorensen test, respectively; vertical jump performance by the sargent jump test; handgrip strength by the handheld dynamometer and flexibility by the sit-and-reach test. These physical capacities will be assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention. Interventions will be performed three times a week for 8 weeks. The analysis will be performed with intent-to-treat analysis and adjusted covariance for baseline outcomes.",

    "BriefSummary": "Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy experience a number of aversive symptoms that are accompanied by declines in physical and mental well-being. Although the benefits of stress management training interventions on quality of life are well documented, there are no published studies examining the efficacy of these interventions among Hispanic women and Latinas (hereafter referred to as Latinas) receiving chemotherapy. This dearth of research reflects the general lack of stress management interventions for cancer patients whose preferred language is Spanish. Simply translating existing English-language interventions into Spanish may seem to be a solution for the lack of Spanish-language stress management interventions. This approach, however, does not take into account cultural values, beliefs and situational realities that are likely to contribute to patients' uptake of health promoting behaviors. The proposed research seeks to address this gap by evaluating a stress management training intervention developed specifically for Latinas beginning chemotherapy for cancer.\n\nIn response to the identified need, the investigators created a Spanish-Language Self-Administered Stress Management Training (SL-SAT) intervention \"C\u00f3mo tratar el estr\u00e9s durante la quimioterapia\" (\"How to manage stress during chemotherapy\"). The intervention is based on an English-language self-administered stress management training intervention the investigators previously developed and showed to be efficacious in a randomized controlled trial. Development of the Spanish-language intervention was the result of extensive use of ethnographic and learner verification methods, guided by a community-based participatory research approach. Similar to the English-language version, the SL-SAT intervention consists of a digital video disc(DVD), booklet, and audio compact disc (CD), and provides instruction in three well-established stress management techniques: deep breathing; progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery; and use of coping self-statements. The proposed study will evaluate the efficacy of this transcreated intervention in a randomized controlled trial involving Spanish-speaking Latinas about to begin chemotherapy for cancer. Following a baseline assessment, participants will receive usual care or usual care plus the SL-SAT intervention. Participants will be reassessed on study measures approximately 7 and 13 weeks after the baseline assessment.",

Dry immersion involves immersing the subject in water covered with an elastic waterproof fabric. As a result, the immersed subject, who is freely suspended in the water mass, remains dry. Within a relatively short duration, the model can faithfully reproduce most physiological effects of actual microgravity, including centralization of body fluids, support unloading, and hypokinesia.\n\nThe objective of the study is to evaluate the physiological changes induced by 5 days of dry immersion in the female organism. The main physiological systems will be explored before, during and after the 5 days of immersion through a battery of specific tests and measurements. The results will be analyzed by scientists specializing in each field in order to better understand the dry immersion model, to compare its effects with those of the bedrest model and those of spaceflight. The clinical (adverse effects, comfort of subjects) and operational aspects are also part of the secondary objectives of the study.",

    "BriefSummary": "Rationale:\n\nApproximately 25% of breast cancers detected are non palpable. Accordingly, a localization technique is required to help the surgeon to find and remove the cancer. The current technique (wire guided localization \\[WGL\\]) is difficult to perform and has a high rate of tumour positive margins in the resected specimen, requiring a second operation. A new approach in the localization and resection of non-palpable malignant breast lesions is 'radio guided occult lesion localization' (ROLL). ROLL was introduced as a possible replacement for WGL at the 'European Institute of Oncology' in Milan in 1996. This technique utilizes the intratumourally injected radiotracer, that is generally used for the lymphatic mapping and SNB, to localize the primary tumour guided by the gamma probe. Five studies so far have proven the applicability of this method.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy of Radio Occult Lesion Localisation (ROLL) versus Wire guided Localisation (WGL) in breast conserving surgery for non-palpable breast cancer\n\nStudy design:\n\nA multicenter, prospective randomized clinical trial. Patients with proven non-palpable breast cancer will be randomized for either ROLL or WGL.\n\nStudy population:\n\n316 women with a core biopsy proven non palpable cT1 breast carcinoma that are eligible for a breast conserving treatment and sentinel node biopsy (SNB).\n\nIntervention (if applicable):\n\nPatients in the WGL group will undergo intra tumoural injection of a nuclear radiotracer under stereotactic or ultrasonographic guidance. After scintigraphic imaging, to monitor the migration of the radiotracer, a guide wire will be inserted under stereotactic or ultrasonographic guidance. The excision of the primary tumour is guided by the inserted wire and the sentinel node procedure is performed using a gamma probe and intratumoural injection of patent blue.\n\nPatients in the ROLL group will undergo the same procedure except for the guide wire insertion. The excision of the primary tumour is guided by the gamma probe.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints:\n\nPrimary study endpoints; ROLL vs WGL:\n\n1. The percentage of tumour-free margins (invasive and in situ)\n2. The volume and maximum diameter of the lumpectomy\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness:\n\nThere is no pre-, per- or post operative extra burden. The radiofarmacon is already used in the standard care of breast cancer patients for the sentinel node biopsy. The used radio-active substance does not damage the patient.\n\nA specific burden questionnaire, aimed at evaluating the burden of the cosmetic result, will be administered. To further assess the net impact in terms of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) also the EQ5D will be obtained at T = 0, 6, 12 and 26 weeks after the initial diagnostic work-up.\n\nShould the results indicate that overall the WGL procedure lead to better clinical outcome a cost-effectiveness analysis is foreseen using bootstrapping to assess the uncertainty with regard to the balance between costs and effects. All analyses will be limited to a half year time horizon. Accordingly, discounting of costs or effects is not applicable.",

The clinical needs include early detection, accurate initial staging and detection of local recurrence or metastases in order to permit application of the most appropriate therapy. Therapeutic monitoring and prognostic assessment are equally important. Imaging can play an important and crucial role in meeting these clinical needs.\n\nPositron emission tomography (PET) imaging has gained an important role in the clinical management of cancer patients. 18F-DCFBC is a novel low molecular weight prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based radiopharmaceutical which is radiolabeled with a fluorine-18 positron emitter for PET imaging. Preclinical mouse prostate cancer tumor model imaging studies of 18F-DCFBC demonstrate high specific uptake in PSMA expressing prostate cancer cells. The investigators will assess the hypothesis that 18F-DCFBC, a new positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical may possess pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that will represent an advance in imaging prostate cancer. This initial phase I study will determine the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and prostate specific tumor uptake in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.",

    "BriefSummary": "Recovery after major abdominal surgery can be longer than other types of surgery. This is because often after abdominal surgery, the bowel does not work normally. When this happens, patients are unable to pass gas. This can lead to bloating, pain, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms are called postoperative ileus.\n\nWe, the researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), are doing this study to compare two methods of treating pain during and after major gynecological surgery. The two methods are called patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) and patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCA). PCA is the standard of care for women having major gynecological surgery. We are going to compare PCEA to PCA to see if PCEA will improve recovery after major gynecologic surgery.\n\nPCEA is a well established method used to ease pain in many settings such as during childbirth and bowel surgery. There have been several studies showing that PCEA is as good as and sometimes better for pain relief than PCA. PCEA may help the bowel work better by preventing ileus after surgery. However, this has never been looked at in women having major gynecologic surgery. This study will also look at whether preventing this ileus will lead to patients going home or returning to regular activities sooner.",

The prevalence survey/ study (1), investigates the prevalence of symptomatic anal incontinence among primiparas at Ostfold Hospital Trust Fredrikstad, Norway and St Olav's Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, Norway, and the results in this study will form the basis of the two identical randomized controlled trials (RCT) investigating the treatment efficacy of PFME two groups of postpartum women. Women reporting symptomatic anal incontinence at six months postpartum (2) and women who have sustained a traumatic 3rd or 4th degree tear of the sphincter ani muscles during delivery (3), respectively, are randomized to an intervention group receiving PFME treatment for six months, or a control group. All RCT participants will undergo examination of PFM strength and activity, as well as anal ultrasound prior to randomization and after the intervention period.",

    "BriefSummary": "The investigators propose to develop and pilot an HIV prevention intervention based on rectal STI testing, counseling, and treatment for MSM in Peru. The investigators will use nucleic acid testing to screen 750 behaviorally high-risk MSM for rectal gonorrheal and/or chlamydial (GC/CT) infection. GC/CT-positive subjects will receive single-dose antibiotic treatment and single-session Personal Cognitive Counseling (PCC) (n=50) or standard post-test counseling (n=50). A GC/CT-negative control group (n=50) will also be enrolled to compare biological outcomes including changes in levels of inflammatory cytokines following rectal STI. The intervention is based on three interrelated objectives: 1) To use periodic rectal STI nucleic acid testing to identify the members of the MSM population at greatest short-term risk for HIV infection; 2) To provide single-dose antibiotic treatment to control the immune activation and mucosal inflammation caused by rectal GC/CT infection that increase cellular risk for HIV transmission; and 3) To use Personal Cognitive Counseling (PCC) to understand and modify recent high-risk sexual practices that led to rectal STI acquisition and that increase future HIV risk.\n\nThe investigators propose to screen 750 behaviorally high-risk MSM for rectal GC/CT infection to enroll 100 GC/CT-positive individuals (using a conservative 15% prevalence estimate) and 50 GC/CT-negative controls (matched by age and baseline frequency of URAI). GC/CT-infected participants will be given single-dose antibiotic therapy and randomized to receive single-session PCC (n=50) or standard post-test counseling (n=50). The primary outcome will be the impact of PCC on self-reported sexual risk behavior (URAI). Secondary outcomes will assess: 1) Feasibility/Acceptability of the STI screening program; 2) Impact of GC/CT infection and treatment on levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1and IL-1\u03b2) in rectal mucosa; 3) Prevalence of persistent/recurrent rectal GC/CT; and 4) HIV incidence in GC/CT-infected and -uninfected MSM.",

    "BriefSummary": "Acute leukaemia (AL) is an aggressive but potentially curable cancer that can affect women of childbearing age. When a pregnancy is complicated by a diagnosis of AL, clinicians face a complex dilemma: to balance risking the mother's survival through delaying treatment, against the potential harm to the foetus through exposure to cancer drugs. Reports suggest that, providing the first trimester is avoided, successful treatment of AL during pregnancy is possible, and considered safe. However, there is currently no standard approach to treatment of these women.\n\nThis observational study aims to monitor and record the current treatment and outcomes of patients diagnosed with acute leukaemia during or prior to pregnancy. Patients will receive the treatment recommended by their doctor, the study will not alter the treatment pathway of participants. This study will establish a new research database of Leukaemia in Pregnancy, initially collecting data from cases since August 2009, and any new cases that are diagnosed during the current funding period.\n\nThe initial planned analyses from this dataset will enable more robust, evidence-based recommendations to be made on how to monitor and manage these patients, and will add value to and improve the existing British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) guidelines, which were largely derived from expert opinion. This should enable healthcare professionals to have greater confidence in managing these patients, leading to a more standardised approach to providing high quality care. The study will benefit National Health Service (NHS) Trusts and patients across the United Kingdom (UK) through more informed clinical decision making with regards to the care they receive. It will also provide an important data resource which researchers can apply to use in further analyses, with plans to continue data collection if further funding is obtained.",

Rates of obesity have doubled to tripled in the past two decades, with the highest rates among poor and ethnic minority girls. Type 2 diabetes (what used to be called adult-onset diabetes) is now showing up in overweight children, and more children are manifesting precursors of heart disease and stroke.\n\nOur Two Approaches:\n\n1. A state-of-the-art nutrition education program with monthly newsletters mailed to girls and their parents and quarterly evening lectures/educational events at school sites, including cooking demonstrations and games to improve nutrition and increase physical activity.\n2. After-school dance classes held five days per week all year long at school sites from the time school lets out until 6PM. Dance classes will include a 1-1.5 hour supervised homework study hall each day, and emphasize both traditional ethnic dances and popular dance.\n\nParticipants: Second, third and fourth grade girls and their families will be eligible to participate. All activities are free of charge. To be able to perform a valid evaluation, to be able to accommodate all girls at their own school, and to be fair about which girls receive which program, families who wish to participate will be randomly selected to participate in either one program or the other (nutrition education or dance classes). Each family will participate for two years.\n\nEvaluation: Trained Stanford staff will perform all evaluation procedures with participating families in their own homes at the beginning and every six months. Families will be compensated for their participation.",

In the light of the whole complexity of the DTM noted the necessity of interdisciplinary treatment, including physical therapy with the use of manual features, has been excelling. Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of mandibular nonspecific mobilization on the mandibular movement and lateralidades, through the three-dimensional kinematics in subjects with diagnosis of TMD, as well as analyze the behavior of pain, quality of life and functionality of individuals with DTM pre, immediately after and 30 days of 12 treatment sessions. Method: This is a clinical trial randomised, placebo-controlled and blind, designed to study the effects of Mandibular Nonspecific Mobilization x Placebo (detuned ultrasound). Individuals will be randomised controlled trials and allocated into two groups: Group A (intervention) and Group B (placebo) and evaluated by the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular joint Disorders (RDC/TMD) for diagnosis of TMD, numeric scale of Pain (END), quality of life questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF), Patient specific Functional Scale and Kinematic Analysis Tridiemsnional. Statistical Analysis: Mandibular movement will be the primary outcome and will be quantified by three-dimensional kinematic analysis. The pain, Functionality and quality of life will be the secondary outcomes. Initially the distribution of data will be checked by the Shapiro-Wilk test. In comparisons between the groups, if the data present normal distribution will be used a repeated measures ANOVA to two factors, being these: Group (intervention and placebo) and treatment (pre and post-intervention), with Bonferrone correction. If the data do not show normal distribution, a logarithmic function is used to correct striping. As level of significance will be used p \\< 0.05.",

    "BriefSummary": "Objectives: This project is a Stage II behavioral development study designed to answer remaining critical questions necessary before disseminating Reinforcement Based Treatment (RBT) to the larger treatment community. These questions focus on the levels of intensity of RBT most efficacious for substance-using pregnant patients. Design: The proposed study utilizes a novel approach to conducting a controlled clinical trial, the sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design. Participants (N=220) will first be randomized at treatment outset into either treatment-as-usual RBT or a reduced intensity RBT. All participants will receive a subsequent randomization based upon an assessment of their initial two weeks of treatment compliance. Early-non-compliant participants will be randomized to receive either the same or an increased level of RBT treatment intensity while early-compliant participants will be randomized to receive either the same or decreased level of treatment intensity and scope. Primary outcome measures include treatment completion, and maternal heroin, cocaine, and other illicit substance use. Secondary outcome measures include maternal measures of HIV risk behavior, and psychosocial functioning and neonatal measures of length of hospitalization, and birth outcomes. Significance: The proposed project's innovation includes: the novelty RBT, use of a cutting-edge SMART model, application of advanced statistical techniques and inclusion of a cost-effectiveness approach. The proposed project's significance is exceedingly high, as it will lay the foundation for later Stage III studies focused on dissemination of stepped care treatment programs for drug-addicted pregnant women that can be implemented not only in comprehensive care clinics but in diverse community settings that provide services to such women.",

The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this observation are emerging, and exposure to particulate air pollution has been shown to result in increases in blood pressure and arterial tone, impaired vascular function and an increased tendency for blood to clot as well as an increase in atherosclerotic plaque burden. Recent evidence from panel studies and controlled exposure studies have suggested an increase in myocardial ischaemia (a reduction in blood flow to the heart) following exposure. In this study we aim to investigate directly myocardial (heart) blood flow following exposure to diesel exhaust (as a model of urban air pollution) using CT/PET myocardial perfusion imaging in male patients with stable coronary disease and healthy male controls. We hypothesize that following exposure to dilute diesel exhaust:\n\n1. Myocardial blood flow will be reduced\n2. Coronary flow reserve will be impaired\n3. The magnitude of impairment will be higher in patients with coronary disease as compared to healthy controls",

The investigators' laboratory played a leading role in defining the estimated average requirement (EAR) and the recommended dietary intake for the \"essential\" amino acids (Dietary Reference Intakes 2005). The other important but less well studied component of Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) is - What is a safe upper limit of intake? The investigators now propose to determine the safe upper limits of the dietary essential amino acids. The recently published DRI (2005) defines the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) as 'the highest average daily nutrient intake level that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population.' As intake increases above the UL, the potential risk of adverse effects may increase'. In this proposal, the investigators define a novel method to define the safe upper limit where the 'maximum oxidative potential' of an amino acid identifies the 'metabolic limit' to dispose the amino acid. Intakes of amino acid above this level will increase the potential for adverse effects to appear.",

Although mounting evidence suggests that alterations in lipid metabolism in persons with abdominal obesity are associated with a several medical complications, including diabetes, little is known about the factors responsible for this effect. The project in this application is designed to examine how the addition of endurance exercise training to a weight-loss program alters whole-body fatty acid availability, uptake, and oxidation as well as the expression of cellular factors that regulate these processes. In addition, we will evaluate whether these alterations are associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity. In the end, these experiments will provide insight into the cellular and whole-body adaptations in fatty acid metabolism in response to weight-loss and exercise training that may lead to enhancement of insulin sensitivity. Identifying relationships between gene expression, whole-body fatty acid metabolism and clinical outcome measurements, such as insulin sensitivity, may lead to improvements in the therapeutic and/or the preventative approach to obesity and its co-morbidities.",

Patients often suffer many somatic and psychological symptoms which contributes negative effect on the health- related quality of life, physical performance and physical activity. Recently, the European League Against Rheumatism presented evidence based recommendations for the management of the fibromyalgia. Accordingly, prompt diagnosis and patient education is required for optimal management. A graduated approach with the aim of improving health-related quality of life should be followed. It should focus \ufb01rst on non-pharmacological modalities and the only \"strong for\" evidence-based recommendation was the use of aerobic and strengthening exercise. Aerobic exercise with moderate intensity (60 to 70% of age-adjusted predicted maximum heart rate (maxHR)) with a frequency of two or three times per week for at least 4 to 6 weeks for a reduction of symptoms is recommended in the management of fibromyalgia. Low-intensity aerobic exercise (\\<50 % maxHR) is founded ineffective. In recent years, high intensity interval training (HIIT) is used as popular instead of moderate intensity continuous exercise training (MICT) in cardiac rehabilitation units. It is found superior to moderate intensity exercise in improving cardiovascular fitness as increases maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max). The investigators hypothesis is that 6 weeks of five weekly sessions of HIIT will show superior effect reducing the impact of fibromyalgia and improving pain degree, functional capacity and health-related quality of life in women with fibromyalgia compared to MICT.",

    "BriefSummary": "This is an observational study in which patient data from the past on men with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer is studied.\n\nMetastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) is a type of advanced prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, and still responds to treatment that lowers testosterone levels.\n\nCancer is a condition in which the body cannot control the growth of cells. The extra cells can form tumors in organs or other parts of the body. If tumors form in the prostate, male hormones (androgens) can sometimes help the cancer spread and grow. The main hormone that does this is called testosterone and is mainly made in the testicles. Men with prostate cancer can have treatments to try to lower the levels of testosterone in the body. One possible treatment is surgery to remove the testicles. Another option is taking treatments to lower the levels of testosterone in the body. These are called androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). In men with mCSPC, ADT can help to stop the cancer from growing and spreading. Men with mCSPC can also receive \"treatment intensification\". This means that they receive ADT as well as other treatments for their prostate cancer. Other studies that looked at treatment of mCSPC in Canada have found that most men with mCSPC do not receive treatment intensification.\n\nIn this study, the researchers want to collect more data about the men who had mCSPC and the types of treatment they received for their mCSPC. The researchers will look at the health information of adult men in Alberta, Canada who had at least 1 dose of treatment for their mCSPC between January 2016 and December 2020 or earlier.\n\nThe study will first look at the health information of men whose cancer had metastasized or spread to other parts of the body, beyond the prostate, at the time they were diagnosed with prostate cancer.\n\nAnd later, if feasible to do, the study may also look at the health information from men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer that was limited to the prostate, and over time spread to other parts of the body.\n\nThe researchers will collect information from databases, a census, and pharmacy records. This will help the researchers learn more about:\n\n* whether the men received ADT alone, or ADT with treatment intensification\n* additional information about the men, including their age, income, level of education, residential area (urban or rural) and the more information about the treatments received\n* how the men's symptoms affected their daily lives\n* how severe the men's cancer was\n* changes in laboratory values as markers for changes to the blood, liver, kidney, bone or other organs\n* need for additional treatment\n* where the men's cancer may have spread to in other parts of the body.\n\nThere will be no required visits with a study doctor or required tests in this study since it's reviewing patient data from the past.\n\nThe researchers will collect this information for about 7 months. The entire study will take about 10 months to finish.",

To best assess this technology, the investigators will focus on patients that have no more than three sites of progressive disease within the central thorax, liver, and/or non-liver abdominopelvis to receive adaptive, MRI-guided and gated SBRT with MRI simulation. Patients will be treated in five fractions over one to two weeks. By adhering to strict normal tissue constraints, expected toxicity will be within the current standard of care but will allow adaptation based on daily anatomic changes. The prescription dose will be determined based on hard normal tissue constraints, and capped at 10Gy per fraction. Although the long term goal will be to achieve improved local control and disease-free survival with reduced toxicity, the present study will be driven by the short term goal of demonstrating the feasibility of this novel treatment approach for recurrent or metastatic ovarian cancer.",

All study participants were apparently healthy, had no active sports injuries, did not use any medications, and were non-smokers. Standardized questionnaires conducted under the supervision of a trained nutritionist were used to collect general data, nutritional habits and use of dietary supplements. The athletes who used any dietary supplements at least a month before the study, were excluded. All participants (or their parents if they were under the age of 18) signed an informed consent document. The study was approved by the Ethical committee of The Military Medical Academy, Belgrade.\n\nThe study was conducted during regular competition season, and lasted for twelve weeks. All participants had the same training and nutritional regime, which excluded intake of berries. The players received 30 mL of liquid chokeberry extract, in the morning before training, once per day for 12 weeks. For the preparation of chokeberry extract (liquid form) was used fruit (berries) of Aronia melanocarpa Elliot, Rosaceae. The extract was donated by Pharmanova Belgrade, Serbia. Process of extraction is performed under specific conditions which are subject of technical patent (producer EUHEM), for the purpose of production of extract with high concentration of polyphenols. The design of the product included few demands: sufficient daily dose of polyphenols to be dietary supplement, small volume which can be consumed as shot and acceptable taste for most consumers. Compliance was monitored by the trainers.",

    "BriefSummary": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the leading cause of death in the U.S. Americans have been more concerned about their blood cholesterol levels and dietary cholesterol intakes rather than their overall cardiovascular health risk factors leading to CVD such as hypertension, vascular dysfunction, inadequate consumption of fruits and vegetables and physical activity. Statistics show that approximately 91% of individuals with CVD have vascular dysfunction which is attributed to endothelial and autonomic dysfunction leading to increased arterial stiffness.\n\nThe investigators long-term goal is to provide feasible and effective dietary ways for pre- and stage 1- hypertensive individuals to normalize their blood pressure (BP), improve vascular function and thereby reducing their cardiovascular risk and enhancing the quality of life. Blueberries are a rich source of phenolic compounds and these compounds may play an important role in promoting cardiovascular health. Considering the strong possibility that phytochemicals present in blueberry work additively or synergistically, it would be ideal to investigate the cardioprotective effects of blueberry as a whole. The investigators overall objective to bring forth evidence that blueberry consumption will reduce BP and cardiovascular risk factors including endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, and autonomic dysfunction in pre- and stage 1-hypertensive postmenopausal women. The investigators hypothesize that blueberry supplementation will improve vascular function and will lower blood pressure in postmenopausal women with pre-hypertension. The findings of this study will provide a foundation for disseminating feasible, safe approaches for preventing and combating hypertension at its early stage which does not require drug therapy.",
