NCT01356862,['Breast Cancer'],2010-09,2012-10,"The principal morbidity following axillary node dissection within the scope of breast cancer surgery is the post-operative development of lymphocele. According to the literature, incidence can vary from 4 to 89% depending on the type of surgery, whether or not a drain is inserted or a compression dressing applied and the time at which the drain is removed... In our experience, the incidence is 40% \[IGR (Gustave Roussy Institute) data focusing on 70 patients between November 2008 and February 2009\]

Encouraging results in terms of reducing postoperative lymphoceles as well as drainage duration and volume using Octreotide have been recorded in two recent studies. A new molecule developed by Novartis Laboratories, namely pasireotide, is a somatostatin analog possessing strong affinity for several somatostatin receptors (30 to 40 times greater for sst1 and sst5, 5 times greater for sst3 and equivalent for sst2)

The purpose of this trial is to assess the efficacy of a pre-surgical injection of pasireotide LAR in reducing the postoperative incidence of symptomatic lymphoceles following axillary node dissection.

The secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy of prolonged release pasireotide on the duration of postoperative drainage, the daily drainage volume, the total drainage volume, the number of repeated lymphocele aspirations and the volume, the total volume of lymph aspirated, the incidence of postoperative febrile episodes, the length of hospital stay, and the length of time to onset of adjuvant chemotherapy. It is also to assess the safety of prolonged release pasireotide.

NCT01450462,['Bacterial Vaginosis'],2011-09,2013-01,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) develops when the concentration of healthy Lactobacillus species in the vagina declines and is replaced by other bacterial species. BV is the most common vaginal infection worldwide, but the etiology of this complex condition is not clear. BV is associated with a 60% increased risk of HIV acquisition as well as numerous other detrimental reproductive outcomes. A profound racial disparity exists in BV prevalence in women in the United States (US): 23% of white women versus. 52% of black women have BV. The investigators hypothesize that inadequate vitamin D contributes to BV development and/or recurrence. Vitamin D is essential to immune function, serving both to stimulate mechanisms associated with pathogen elimination and to regulate immune response. According to nationally-representative data, 90% of US blacks have insufficient vitamin D levels. In two recent analyses, low vitamin D was associated with higher BV prevalence in pregnant African-Americans; a third replicated this finding in pregnant African-American and white women. The investigators wish to conduct a small, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation among non-pregnant, BV-positive women at a public sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic.

NCT01862991,['Legally Induced Abortion Without Mention of Complication'],2013-07,2016-06,"This research study investigates the use of a drug, mifepristone, given before second trimester abortion. Mifepristone is a medication that is approved for medical abortion during the first trimester. It also has been used prior to abortion in the early seconds trimester (14-16 weeks gestation) and for medication abortion in the second trimester (also called induction abortion). This medication has effects on the uterus that may help dilate, or open, the cervix. Abortion requires opening of the cervix to safely remove the pregnancy. Cervical dilation, or opening, is essential to both ease of completion of procedure and reducing complications that can occur. These complications include laceration, or tearing, of the cervix and perforation of the uterus (a hole made unintentionally in the muscle wall of the uterus) and are not expected to be increased in the study. Dilation of the cervix is usually achieved by placing thin rods (cervical dilators) through the cervix. These rods then absorb the moisture of the vagina and slowly expand, opening the cervix. The standard method of dilation is performed at the clinic and involves the placement of cervical dilators the day before the procedure. This procedure can be uncomfortable. A prior study showed that mifepristone reduces the number of osmotic dilators that need to be placed prior to the procedure after 19 weeks gestation. We aim to investigate mifepristone as a potential adjunct to cervical dilation or used alone, without dilators, as method of cervical preparation with the hopes of reducing barriers imposed by painful procedures and time in clinic and away from work/home that the current approach involving dilators requires.",80,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A

NCT01235091,"['HIV', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Substance Abuse']",2000-08,2004-11,"Women Teaching Women (WTW) is proposed by a team of Washington University investigators who have focused on HIV prevention efforts among out-of-treatment injecting drug users (IDUs) and crack cocaine users, since 1988. Our peer-delivered prevention model was successful in reducing cocaine use among men. The investigators believe no differences were found in drug and sexual risk behaviors for women because the intervention lacked gender-specificity. Thus, the investigators propose to tailor our previous intervention to women's needs to determine the shorter and intermediate term effectiveness of a gender-specific model on reducing drug use and sexual risks. The urgency for women-focused interventions is highlighted by increasing HIV/STD rates among women nationwide. The intervention is designed to bring the HIV prevention message to women in a public health environment. The three-arm intervention, which targets out-of-treatment drug-using women, will assess the differential impact of a woman-centered standard intervention alone, the same standard intervention plus a well-woman exam, and those plus the addition of 4 educational sessions. This proposal responds to two NIDA PAs: 95-083 (Women's HIV Risk and Protective Behaviors) and 96-018 (Drug Abuse Prevention Intervention for Women and Minorities). Our risk reduction, epidemiological and technology transfer aims include:

Risk Reduction Aims:

1. Recruit out-of-treatment female drug injectors, heroin, crack/cocaine and methamphetamine users to into an intervention aimed at reducing high risk sexual and drug use behaviors. Street outreach, bars and clubs, shelters, health fairs and daycare facilities will be used to reach these vulnerable women at risk.
2. Administer a modified theory-based, peer-delivered, gender and culture-specific intervention that encourages women to reduce their high risk drug and sexual behaviors. Women will be randomly assigned to one of three peer-delivered interventions: a modified NIDA Cooperative Agreement Standard Intervention (SI), the SI + Well-Woman Exam (SI+WWE), or the SI+Well-Woman Exam + 4 Educational Sessions (SI+WWE+4ES). The Standard Intervention will be delivered by peers; the Well-Woman Examination will be conducted by a nurse practitioner; the four 2 hour educational sessions will be conducted by peer facilitators from area drug treatment programs paired with a community mental health or health professional.
3. Assess the effectiveness of the interventions in reducing drug and sexual risk at 4 and 12 months post-intervention, controlling for baseline characteristics.
4. Evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of each intervention.

   Epidemiologic Aim:
5. Assess: a) incidence of HIV, Hepatitis B and C, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea 12 months post-intervention; b) change in HIV risk and drug and alcohol use at 4 and 12 months post-intervention; c) the effect of psychopathology on behavior change at 12 months post-intervention; d) lifetime history of substance abuse and service utilization for mental and physical problems at baseline.

   Technology Transfer Aim:
6. Disseminate findings to the scientific community, practitioners and community members in formats that are appropriate, understandable, and usable in order that the best possible women-centered intervention can be developed for reducing HIV risk behaviors.

NCT02291562,['Healthy Volunteers'],2014-07,2014-12,"THC and CBD have distinct symptomatic and behavioral effects. In healthy individuals, THC can induce psychotic symptoms and anxiety, and can impair memory. In contrast, CBD has anxiolytic and possibly antipsychotic properties, while not impairing memory and other cognitive functions. Instead, CBD has been shown to have significant neuroprotective effects. In humans, CBD values correlated positively with gray matter concentration in bilateral hippocampus. Recent data from experimental animals and in vitro studies suggest that these distinct effects might be caused by opposing effects on brain cannabinoid receptors.

Neuroimaging studies have consistently identified brain activity recorded at prefrontal and medial temporal regions as relevant for episodic memory. Additionally, the abundance of cannabinoid receptors in the hippocampus and the parahippocampal and entorhinal cortices suggests a potential impact of CBD in memory deficits typical in healthy aging. However, the evidence relating cannabinoids to these conditions is relatively recent and has been obtained from either biochemical or pharmacological studies.

Candidates are screened with a neurological examination and neuropsychological testing that includes questions about their feelings, experiences, and behavior, and tests of reading level and intelligence.

Participants undergo fMRI and fill out questionnaires before and after the scanning. Some children are asked to play 20 minutes of video games before the test.

One factor that has impeded such research has been low levels of patient compliance with exercise protocols. One robust strategy for promoting and maintaining behavior change is contingency management or Behavioral Incentives (BI). BI delivers incentives (prizes, vouchers) contingent upon target behaviors such as cocaine abstinence (Higgins et al., 1994); treatment attendance (Svikis et al., 1997) and other pro-social behaviors (Kirby et al., 1998). While the literature is replete with studies demonstrating the benefit of BI compared to control conditions (Stitzer \& Petry, 2006), the translation of BI methods from research to clinical practice has met with some resistance. Contributing factors include philosophical differences (e.g., counselors feel extrinsic reinforcement undermines recovery) and practical barriers (e.g., monetary costs of incentives may be prohibitive). The latter concern was addressed by Petry (2005) who developed the ""fish bowl"" method, which uses escalating variable ratio procedures to reduce per patient costs of BI with similar effect sizes.

As a Stage 1 behavioral therapies development grant (Rounsaville et al., 2001), the primary aim of this research is to pilot test a BI intervention designed to promote regular physical activity in a sample of women receiving inpatient treatment for SUDs. The target behavior, physical activity, will be objectively defined as 30 minutes of observed treadmill walking at any intensity 3 days/week at Level 1, and 30 minutes of higher intensity physical activity that meets ACSM criteria for moderate exercise Level 2. Specifically, a pilot randomized clinical trial will compare rates of physical activity over a 6 week study period in a sample of N=50 women with Cocaine Dependence. All participants will complete baseline assessment, attend a 45-min Health and Fitness (HF) education group, followed by random assignment to either the experimental (BI) or control (C) groups, with equal daily access to on-site treadmills. Those randomized to BI, however, will also be eligible 3 days/week, to receive incentives for completing 30 minutes of treadmill walking.

Incentives will be dispensed using Petry Fish Bowl methods. Women assigned to the BI group will receive behavioral incentives (in the form of gift cards or prizes) for completing their scheduled exercise sessions (Level 1), and have the opportunity to earn ""bonus"" draws for meeting moderate intensity exercise criteria, as specified by ACSM (2007, revised) guidelines (Level 2). In Level 1, the number of tokens participants can draw from the gym bag (present study equivalent to ""fishbowl"") at each visit will be linked to exercise session attendance, with consistent attendance resulting in greater number of draws. In Level 2, the number of tokens a participant can draw from the gym bag will be linked to the intensity of the participant's exercise. Specifically, beginning in Week 2 of the study, participants will be re-evaluated for exercise capability. Those who pass the safety screen will be encouraged to exercise at a higher intensity, and those who do not will be re-evaluated until they obtain safety clearance. Once cleared, if the participant meets criteria for moderate exercise during her scheduled session, then she will be allotted a ""bonus"" draw (Level 2) for meeting Level 2 criteria, in addition to the escalating number of draws she would received for scheduled exercise session completion (Level 1).

Scheduled treadmill walking will be monitored and recorded for both BI and C group women. Follow-ups will occur at study midpoint and completion (3 and 6 weeks post-randomization, respectively), and at 4 weeks post-discharge. Assessments will focus on drug craving, mood, stress, motivation/self-efficacy, and physical health and well being. The investigators hypothesize that women in the BI group will complete more treadmill sessions and spend more time treadmill walking than those in the C group. As a Stage 1b therapy development RCT, study data will be used for effect size estimation in preparation for Stage 2 RCT. This dissertation proposal will provide benchmark data on the utility of BI for promoting physical activity. Further, it will promote exercise compliance, allowing scientists to better evaluate potential benefits of physical activity on treatment outcomes in women with SUDs.",26,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A

While natural rubber latex (NRL) male condoms has majority proportion of male condoms in the market, synthetic male condoms (SMC) made from polyurethane or other synthetic materials remain new to the consumers. Notably, synthetic male condoms are found to be more durable, non-allergenic and have better compatibility with lubricants when compared to NRL male condoms.

The objective of this study is to help identify the best practice regarding the use of indwelling catheter after minimally invasive urogynecologic surgery. Investigators propose a randomized controlled trial comparing the immediate removal of indwelling urethral catheter, after minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy, to the present standard catheter removal on post operative day one. Evidence based catheter management will be helpful to both providers and patients in post-operative decision making.

Specific Aims

Aim 1: To demonstrate that immediate removal of catheter after minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy results in shorter hospital stay than removal on postoperative day 1.

Aim 2: To demonstrate that immediate removal of catheter after minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy confers no increased risk of re-catheterization.

Aim 3: To demonstrate that immediate removal of catheter after minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy decreases the occurrence of urinary tract infection.

Design

A randomized controlled trial comparing the standard overnight indwelling urethral catheterization with removal of catheter immediately post surgery after minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy, at Oregon Health \& Science University.

Outcome measures

Primary outcome measures are hospital stay in hours after completion of surgery and need for re-catheterization. Hospital stay will be counted from the time the patient leaves the operating room to the time she leaves the hospital. To avoid confounding, investigators are only including the first / morning case of the day. For re-catheterization, investigators will evaluate if patient was able to void after completion of surgery. Investigators will compare the post voiding residuals, the need for re-catheterizations and the numbers of patients going home with an indwelling catheter between the two groups. Investigators will also compare the number of urinary tract infections, as documented by urine culture and subsequent treatment, between the two groups.

At Present, Lung Cancer in women and in men is treated similarly. Nevertheless, numerous studies shows that lung cancer in women has specificities : at the time of the diagnosis female patients are younger, there are less clinical signs, clinical stages are earlier, histology is often adenocarcinoma. The link with tabagism is weaker . Sensitivity to tabagism is higher (more cancer in women with the same tabagism). Response rate to chemotherapy is better. Prognosis is better

Numerous hypotheses have been put forward to account for the specific characteristics of female lung cancer described above.

* One hypothesis is that there are different genetic anomalies in women. Some studies show an increase of EGFR mutation and HER2 expression and a decrease of expression of repair enzymes (ERCC1, RRM1, BRCA) which can explain the increase sensitivity to tabagism and to chemotherapy.
* Another hypothesis is that hormones play a role in oncogenesis. Indeed, lung cancer presents hormonal risk factors : pre-menopause, less than 3 kids, short menstrual cycle, hormone replacement therapy. Estrogens would have a deleterious effect on cancer incidence and on survival of lung cancer in women. Cellular and animal models show that ER pathway is activated in lung cancer and participates in oncogenesis.
* Moreover an interaction between RE and EGFR pathway has been demonstrated on lung cancer cell lines and mouse models.

EGFR-TKI have shown benefit in women with wild type EGFR or unknown status (with erlotinib) and in women with EGFR mutations (with gefitinib). In this study, the use of these two treatment will be in accordance with their market authorisations.

The objective of this study is to test the addition of an anti-estrogen (fulvestrant) to EGFR-TKI. Fulvestrant is a pure anti-oestrogen that binds to ER, blocks it and accelerates its breakdown. It has a market authorisation in breast cancer.

NOTES offers all the advantages of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and also completely eliminates trauma to the abdominal wall and the numerous complications of abdominal wall incisions. A NOTES procedure eliminates any visible scar and could also potentially reduce post operative pain due to the elimination of abdominal wall trauma.

Hence, geographic barriers and limited information sources are likely to influence women's access to skilled birth attendance.

The treatment management of single BM remains controversial. Indeed, even though it is widely accepted that local treatment increases the median survival time in patients having a good prognostic status, the adding of ""adjuvant"" whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is currently subject to controversy, due to its potential toxicity. Yet, two randomized trials have demonstrated a clear increase in intra-cerebral recurrence and in death from neurologic origin in case of absence of ""adjuvant"" WBRT, without change in overall survival (but overall survival was not a primary endpoint in any of these studies).

The data from literature on cognitive toxicity (CT) of WBRT on BM are scarce and sometimes controversial. CT of WBRT affects the subcortical frontal functions. It is postulated that the alteration of hippocampal neurogenesis (mainly due to inflammation process), situated in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, has an essential role in the development of these brain dysfunctions.

It has been shown that the incidence of BM in the hippocampal region (hippocampus + 5mm expansion) is low, in the range of 8,6%.

New irradiation techniques, in particular intensity-modulated radiotherapy associated with rotational radiotherapy, allow to modulate the dose on an intra-cerebral structure, all the while distributing an adapted dose to the remaining brain.

This prospective, randomized study, will compare, through a battery of neuropsychological tests, the cognitive impact of WBRT of 40 Gy in 20 fractions with or without hippocampal avoidance by intensity modulated radiotherapy, in patients presenting with a single operated brain metastasis of breast cancer. If the hippocampal avoidance leads to a significant improvement in cognitive function, this radiotherapy scheme could become the standard postoperative treatment to be proposed to patients presenting the best prognostic factors. This would allow to prevent long-term cognitive deficit, while preserving WBRT benefit on intra-cerebral control.

Justification of evaluation criteria :

Principal criteria :

Evaluation criteria to assess cognitive toxicity have been selected on the basis of the recommendations from C. Meyers and P. Brown, who propose an adapted test battery to evaluate memory, verbal function, visual and motor coordination, and executive function. The selected tests have been validated, also in French. They comprise HVLT-R (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised), COWAT (Controlled Oral Word Association Test), Grooved Pegboard test, TMT A and B (Trailmaking tests A and B), and MMSE. The calculation of patient numbers was based on the HVLT-R test, as memory is thought to be the most frequently affected domain.

The tests will be performed before treatment (""baseline"" cognitive function), at 4 months and at 12 months. In case of a missing answer to the evaluation tests, the reason(s) for not answering will be noted.

In patients undergoing SSM and immediate breast reconstruction there will be a decrease in the rate of MFN in those who receive NTG ointment compared to those who receive placebo.",154,FEMALE,21 Years,65 Years
NCT03417362,"['Abortion Early', 'Abortion in First Trimester']",2018-03-05,2019-03-12,"The majority of abortions in the United Kingdom (UK) are performed before 9 weeks (63 days) gestation using a method known as Early Medical Abortion (EMA). EMA involves an assessment visit and provision of two types of medication .

The assessment visit usually involves Ultrasound to confirm gestation, detailed personal history, safeguarding assessment and contraception planning, before arranging treatment and follow up.

The process is long and lots of information is given to women attending the service. In NHS Lothian (National Health Service, Lothian Health Board), the average appointment length for combined assessment and provision of the first part of treatment is 3 hours.

Despite how common abortion is ( 1 in 3), many women presenting for abortion care are not aware of what the procedure will involve. This may in part to the social stigma surrounding abortion and unintended pregnancy in general. This stigma can in turn result in feelings of anxiety and shame about the decision to terminate a pregnancy.

There is evidence that short videos shown to patients prior to abortion or contraception consultations can improve their ability to recall information and can make them feel more confident about the procedure.

Additionally, abortion care providers have found patients who have seen videos to be better prepared and informed and this allows consultations to progress more easily and allow greater time for discussion of contraceptive methods.

We have prepared a video approximately 3 minutes in length to provide information about EMA. It summarises the process described above using simple language and animated characters. The video has been translated into French, Portuguese and Swedish and has been adapted to reflect subtle differences in practice and law in these countries.

The need for a systematic ultrasound evaluation at the last weeks of a low-risk pregnancy and the best time to perform it remains controversial. The most commonly used clinical screening tool in this population is the serial measurement of symphysis-fundus distance, which is a method of a variable and low sensitivity for detection of FGR.

In Portugal, in accordance with guidelines of Direcção Geral de Saúde from 2015, fetal growth restriction screening in low risk pregnancies is performed with an ultrasound for fetal weight estimation at 30th-33rd weeks. Nonetheless, recent data from randomized trials showed that FGR detection rate was superior at 36 vs 32 weeks' gestation. In cases of severe FGR, detection rate was also superior at 36 vs 32 weeks' gestation. In a prior retrospective study, our group analyzed 1429 term low risk pregnancies and the investigators concluded that small for gestational age term babies (birthweight \< 10th centile) had a statistically significant higher rate of operative deliveries for intrapartum fetal distress than appropriate for gestational age as well as a higher rate of admission to neonatal intensive care unit. Moreover the investigators compared the same outcomes within small for gestational age neonates with antepartum detection at 30th-33rd weeks ultrasound vs undetected (normal 30th-33rd weeks ultrasound). Antepartum detection of small for gestational age neonates showed a statistically significant lower rate of operative deliveries for intrapartum fetal distress than undetected small for gestational age neonates. The investigators will conduct a prospective randomized clinical trial with the aim to evaluate if a 35th-37th weeks after the standard of care ultrasound in low risk pregnancies is effective in improving the detection rate of FGR and in reducing cesarean deliveries for intrapartum fetal distress and admission to neonatal intensive care unit.",1093,FEMALE,15 Years,45 Years

In clinical practice, however, these women are still underappreciated for their CVD risk. It has not been established yet how adequate lifelong prevention in these potentially high risk women can optimally be achieved from their childbearing years onwards.

OBJECTIVE:

To evaluate feasibility, usability, acceptance and potential obstacles of blood pressure (BP) home monitoring in high-risk women, aged 40-60 years, after a previous PE in pregnancy. In addition to evaluate the effectiveness of BP home monitoring on the occurrence of hypertension, the efficacy of BP treatment, quality of life (QOL), health-related symptoms, work ability and life-style behaviour.

Cesarean section (C/S) is usually performed under spinal with preservative free morphine for pain relief, but the investigators have a severe shortage of this formulation of morphine. Hydromorphone is a narcotic which acts peripherally and centrally to decrease pain. It has been used in spinals for postoperative pain relief and in pain pumps for relief of chronic pain. No randomized controlled studies have evaluated intrathecal (IT) hydromorphone for post C/S pain.

Methods:

This is a randomized double-blind controlled trial utilizing the up-down sequential allocation method1,2 to find the best dose of IT hydromorphone that provides pain relief following C/S. Patients will be given a morphine PCA pump for additional pain relief. Our first patient will receive 200 mcg of IT hydromorphone. Pain, nausea, and itching will be evaluated at 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours following the C/S via numeric rating scales; vomiting and morphine use per hour will be recorded. Success will be a median morphine usage of less than or equal to 1mg/hour in the following 16 hours. If a success, the next patient will be given 10 mcg less IT hydromorphone; if a failure, she will receive 10 mcg more. The study will end after 5 successes.

Objective:

The primary objective is to find the optimal dose of IT hydromorphone for pain relief following C/S. The secondary objectives are to define the incidence and severity of hydromorphone's side effects and determine the duration of analgesia.",54,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A

The incidence of gastrointestinal infections is very high. In Western countries at least 30% of the population suffers from at least one food-borne infection per year. Mostly because of the problem of antibiotic resistance, more emphasis is put on prevention of infections. One of the possibilities is to strengthen human resistance to gut infections by consumption of probiotics. A specific blend of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus helveticus Rosell-52, Lactobacillus rhamnosus Rosell-11, Bifidobacterium longum Rosell-175) and a probiotic yeast (Saccharomyces boulardii), improved stool consistency and shortened the duration of diarrhea in a rat model of E.coli-induced diarrhea. These probiotics showed synergistic effects compared with administration of solely S. boulardii or a mixture of L. helveticus Rosell-52, L. rhamnosus Rosell-11, B. longum Rosell-175. Consumption of S. boulardii and a combination of L. helveticus Rosell-52, L. rhamnosus Rosell-11 reduced diarrhea in humans.

Aim:

To study whether probiotics improves the resistance of humans to enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC).

Study design:

The PROTETEC study is a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled 4-weeks intervention with probiotics in healthy volunteers. In this study, the effect of probiotic intervention vs placebo on several infection markers in response to an ETEC challenge is investigated. Participants will be randomly assigned to the probiotic or placebo group (n=30 per group). Subjects will be instructed to maintain their usual pattern of physical activity and their habitual food intake, but to standardize their dietary calcium intake. After an adaptation period of 2 weeks, subjects will be orally infected with a live, but attenuated, ETEC vaccine (strain E1392-75-2A; collection NIZO food research; dose 10E10 CFU). Before and after infection, a diary will be kept to record all food and drinks consumption (2x2 days) to assess the habitual dietary intake, as well as for daily recording of bowel habits and frequency and severity of gastrointestinal complaints. The following biological samples will be collected: 4x10 ml venous blood, a single fecal bolus (for screening) and 7x24 hrs feces. Blood is sampled for immune response analyses and the fecal samples are collected to quantify several infection- and immune system markers, to determine probiotic excretion, and to verify dietary calcium intake.

So, there is a need for an alternative way by which we can begin NMC retraining sooner. By training the non-affected ankle (Cross education), clinicians can begin NMC retraining before the individuals can bear weight on the affected ankle, in the acute stage of healing, or even if there is any other precautions or contraindications to exercise due to the injuries. Athletes with more chronic injuries may be able to perform NMC and functional retraining at higher levels than otherwise would be possible by initiating the training on the non affected ankle. Initiating these activities on the non-affected ankle will result in earlier improvements in postural control and function in the affected ankle.

By this way, the rehabilitation times will be short, athletes can return earlier to sport participation or work, health care costs will decrease. Up to the knowledge of the author, there is a gap in research investigating cross education effect of balance program in patients with ankle instability. So, the current study was conducted to reveal the role of this phenomena in such cases and add this phenomenon on the physical therapy field to manage patients with ankle instability (If Cross Education phenomena is effective, this phenomena will be used in rehabilitation).",10,FEMALE,18 Years,35 Years

NCT01857466,['Ovarian Cysts'],2012-12,2013-10,"Laparoscopy has become the gold standard for the surgical treatment of benign ovarian cysts and is usually performed by stripping the ovarian cyst wall, followed by bleeding control of the ovarian wound ground using bipolar coagulation. However, the hemostasis with bipolar coagulation could result in the damage of ovarian reserve and decrease the response of the ovaries to hormonal stimulation for assisted reproductive technologies. The possible mechanism may contribute to thermal destruction of ovarian follicles by excessive use of bipolar coagulation for hemostasis purposes.

To avoid additional ovarian tissue damage by conventional bipolar coagulation being potentially important ovarian reproductive function, hemostasis using various topical hemostatic agents has introduced to control post-cystectomy ovarian wound bleeding. Among them, FloSeal (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, USA) is a hemostatic matrix sealant composed of a gelatin-based matrix and thrombin solution. On coming into contact with blood after application at a bleeding site, the gelatin particles swell and tamponade bleeding. The bulk of the gelatin matrix-thrombin composite has the effect of slowing blood flow and providing exposure to a high thrombin concentration, thus hastening clot formation. Therefore, it may more suitable for use in post-cystectomy ovarian wound bleeding, where there is superficially pervasive focus of bleeding.

Ovarian reserve is defined as the functional potential of the ovary, which reflects the number and quality of antral follicles left in the ovary, and is correlated with the response to ovarian stimulation using exogenous gonadotropin. Serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) has been accepted as the most reliable and easily measurable marker for postoperative assessment of ovarian reserve.

The investigators conducted a multicenter, large-scale, randomized controlled trial to investigate whether hemostasis by Floseal was superior to that by bipolar coagulation in preserving ovarian reserve by assessing serial AMH levels in patients undergoing laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy for benign ovarian cysts.",100,FEMALE,18 Years,45 Years

NCT01592526,['Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome'],2012-06,2013-01,"Critical illness, severe infection, extensive trauma or tissue damage cause an inflammatory (irritative) reaction in the body. This reaction affects the whole body and causes malaise, circulatory and cardiac changes, fever, increases the number of white blood cells in the blood stream and prompts release of signaling proteins. This reaction contributes to the development of considerable organ damage and possibly organ failure. These are serious complications in critical illness which are associated with a high mortality. This inflammatory reaction is affected by the autonomic nervous system. This is the part of the nervous system, which is beyond the control of the free will, and the part that regulates circulation, breathing and digestive functions. The autonomic nervous system works via so-called sympathetic signals, which set the body in a state of alertness to overcome immediate challenges, and parasympathetic (vagal) signals, which are especially active during restitution and rest. It is known, that the balanced activity in the autonomic nervous system affects the body's inflammatory response in critical illness. A study in mice has shown that if parasympathetic (vagal) signals are blocked mortality in critical illness is increased. Reversely, when the autonomic nervous system is medically stimulated towards parasympathetic signaling, the magnitude of the inflammatory response is decreased. Nicotine exerts this stimulatory effect.

Also, we know that individuals in good physical shape have increased parasympathetic tone compared to less trained individuals. However, studies have never addressed whether this shifted balance in the autonomic nervous system affects the inflammatory response related to critical illness.

Over the last 30 years an experimental model mimicking the inflammatory response has been used in studies. Inflammation may be simulated by injecting the drug E.Coli LPS, which induces a controlled, fully reversible, harmless reaction the duration of which is a few hours. Influenza-like symptoms occur and changes in circulatory parameters and concentrations of signaling proteins can be measured.

Using this experimental model, the investigators wish to study whether this shifted balance in the autonomic nervous system in individuals in good physical shape affects the body's reaction to critical illness. Investigators also want to determine how nicotine (using a nicotine patch) affects this reaction.",23,MALE,18 Years,35 Years

* ovarian stimulation with medications that are effective in women with diminished ovarian reserve but adversely affect the endometrium
* oocyte retrieval and vitrification
* fertilization and embryo transfer in a subsequent cycle with controlled endometrial preparation B) To determine the optimal stimulation protocol for women with diminished ovarian reserve incorporating oocyte vitrification

Studies indicate that elevation of plasma-FFA induces insulin resistance and also causes endothelial dysfunction as well as hemodynamic changes which are supposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular disorders.

Glomerular hyperfiltration, which is associated with glomerular hypertension and hypertrophy, a common finding in the early course of type 1 diabetes as well as type 2 diabetes, plays an important role in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. These hemodynamic changes are not well understood, but are most likely induced by dilatation of the (precapillary) glomerular arteriole.

In humans the hemodynamic effect of FFAs has so far been investigated locally in brachial and femoral arteries and recently in the eye and skin, where FFAs induced a pronounced increase in blood flow probably due to a local decrease in vascular resistance.

NCT01220765,['Alveolar Hypoventilation Resulting in Hypoxemia'],2010-04,2011-02,"Rationale: The current standard of respiratory monitoring for patients during deep sedation is continuous pulse oximetry with visual assessment of the patient. Clinical research has demonstrated that depressed respiratory activity is a principal risk factor for hypoxemia during sedation. Capnography may provide early detection of alveolar hypoventilation before hypoxemia has occurred in nonintubated patients and thereby improve patient safety during sedation.

Objective: At the Centre for Contraception, Sexuality and Abortion Leiden, abortion procedures are performed under deep sedation using propofol. Patient's monitoring is performed by nurses qualified in patient sedation management, using pulse oximetry and their clinical judgement. The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of capnography in early detection of alveolar hypoventilation during deep sedation in comparison to standard monitoring with pulse oximetry in abortion procedures.

Study design: This protocol describes a prospective, open, randomized controlled trial with two study arms. All patients receive standard care of monitoring performed by the medical staff. The study investigates whether capnography prevents patients from having respiratory events during deep sedation in abortion procedures by early detection and therapy. Patients randomized to the standard care group receive standard of respiratory monitoring using pulse oximetry. In the capnography arm, respiratory monitoring is performed with pulse oximetry and capnography.

Study population: The study population comprises female patients (≥ 18 years) undergoing abortion procedures during first or second trimester pregnancies. Abortion procedures are performed until 22 weeks of gestational age.

Capnography: In addition application of capnography during deep sedation with propofol is performed. Before the trial starts, all nurses qualified in patient sedation management and abortion doctors will be trained in assessment of capnography. In the capnography arm, patients' breathing is additionally monitored with capnography. If alveolar hypoventilation is detected medical staff will intervene by arousing the patient, performing chin lift, repositioning the head, provision of oxygen, or abandon from giving additional propofol. These interventions represent the standard of care currently used by the clinical staff to respond to hypoventilation and hypoxemia.

Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is the occurrence of oxygen saturations to ≤90% in the population, as measured by continuous pulse oximetry. Secondary study outcomes include occurrence of oxygen saturations \< 80%, dose of administered propofol, arousal or movement of the patient during the procedure, airway interventions, early termination of the procedure due to respiratory problems, episodes of bradycardia, and administration of atropine.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: The risks related to the conduct of this study are negligible and the burden minimal. Patients in both groups receive the current standard of care. Patients randomized in the capnography group could get benefit from the addition of capnography to the monitoring by early detection of alveolar hypoventilation. Capnography is a noninvasive measurement by means of a cannula under the nose, which before the sedation may tickle, but during sedation no inconvenience is expected.",440,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A

* Cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection of the lining of the cervix with some kinds of human papillomaviruses (HPV). These HPV infections are distantly related to the viruses that cause warts on the skin. Like common wart viruses, most women who have cervical infections with HPV resolve the infections within 2 years without any need for treatment. Cervical infections that do not go away may cause disease that can turn into cancer after many years.

* Participants have a cervical examination, HPV test, Pap test and blood test.
* Women whose tests show they are infected with HPV or have cervical disease will do the following:
* see a doctor and have cervical biopsies of all white abnormal areas (removal of a small tissue sample from the cervix)
* have photographs of the cervix taken
* have a cervical scraping for a new kind of HPV test.
* Some women with normal test results are also asked to see a doctor to check the validity of the testing

NCT00118027,"['Malaria', 'Pregnancy', 'Anemia']",2003-05,N/A,"SUMMARY

Background: Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among pregnant women in Uganda. Although effective tools for prevention and control of malaria exist, their delivery presents a problem. Intermittent presumptive treatment (IPT) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is effective, yet \>60% of women in Uganda do not get it as \< 40%, attend antenatal care. Effective ways of delivering IPT with SP to pregnant women at a community level need to be developed. This study assessed whether community based resource persons like traditional birth attendants (TBAs), community reproductive health workers (CRHWs), adolescent peer mobilizers (APMs) and drug-shop owners (DSV) can distribute IPT with SP to pregnant women.

Objectives: The objectives of this study were:

* To assess community based approaches for delivering malaria prevention to pregnant women in Uganda;
* To assess community perceptions, beliefs and practices associated with malaria treatment and prevention in pregnancy;
* To assess whether community based resource persons can deliver IPT to pregnant women and reach those most at risk;
* To assess the impact of IPT on anaemia and pregnancy outcome;
* To estimate cost-effectiveness of the approaches and assess the acceptability and sustainability of the approaches.

Methods: The study was conducted in 5 sub-counties of the Mukono district, situated on the shores of L. Victoria in Central Uganda. The district is hyper-endemic for malaria. 25 parishes with a total population of 75,000 people were used to test the new approaches. Phase 1 obtained qualitative data on community perceptions, beliefs and practices associated with malaria prevention in pregnancy. Phase 2 was an intervention study that assessed distribution of IPT to pregnant women by TBAs, CRHWs, APMs and DSVs compared with health units. Pregnant women of all parities were enrolled. Key resource persons in each parish were identified to sensitise the communities on the intervention. Data was collected regarding: timing of the first dose of SP, proportion of women who complete two doses of SP, birth weight of babies, proportion of low birth-weight babies, and proportion of adolescent pregnancies. The third phase of the study evaluated the sustainability of the approaches.

Work Plan: The first phase of the study took two months. The second phase took 14-16 months. Data analysis was expected to take 12 months.",2150,FEMALE,N/A,N/A

NCT00188773,"['Insulin Resistance Syndrome X', 'Pancreatic Beta Cell Function']",2004-01,2007-08,"A prolonged elevation of plasma free fatty acids (FFA) impairs glucose stimulated insulin secretion. The concept of fatty acid impairment of glucose stimulated insulin secretion (lipotoxicity) has now been well accepted. Increased free fatty acid flux from adipose tissue to non-adipose tissue, resulting from abnormalities of fat metabolism, participates in and amplifies many of the metabolic derangements that are characteristic of insulin resistance syndrome and type 2 diabetes.

Lipotoxicity is also likely to play an important role in the progression from normal glucose tolerance to fasting hyperglycemia and conversion to frank type 2 diabetes in insulin resistant individuals. This area of research is now focused on determining the mechanisms whereby FFAs impair b-cell function. There is some evidence to suggest that lipotoxicity could be mediated through induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a known potent antioxidant and has been used experimentally in a number of medical conditions in humans for its protective antioxidant effects. The investigators now plan to administer NAC orally to humans for 48 hours to examine the effects of antioxidant therapy in ameliorating the deleterious effects of FFAs on pancreatic beta cell function. NAC is currently approved for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose and is also used as a mucolytic agent.

ADT slows disease progression and prolongs survival, but it also leads to worse quality of life (QOL), fatigue, loss of strength and fitness, osteoporosis, and diabetes.

The investigators' recent research has shown that individually supervised exercise, supervised group exercise and home-based exercise are equally good at improving these side effects. Now the investigators are doing a larger trial with multiple centres to see whether supervised group or home-based exercise is clinically better and more economical.

A major challenge in such trials is that a significant number of men refuse to be randomized because (a) the participant lives too far from a study centre and cannot come for supervised exercise; or (b) the participant has a strong preference as to which type of exercise program the participant wants to do. Experts have raised concerns that classic randomized trials are too restrictive, selective, and less practical; the study results are less applicable to the real world. Despite its obvious importance, it is not known whether men who refuse to be randomized to an exercise trial but are otherwise willing to participate would benefit similarly to men who are randomized. In this study, we will recruit men who are otherwise eligible for our randomized trial but refuse it for one of the reasons above. We will allow these men to choose either supervised group or home-based exercise, and then compare them to the men who are being randomized to the two treatments in 3 important ways. First, are participants similar in terms of personal characteristics, QOL, and fitness levels? Second, do participants respond similarly to exercise in terms of QOL and physical fitness benefits? Third, do participants actually exercise as much as the randomized men? This work will help the research team understand whether there is a need to change the way exercise trials are done in order to be more relevant and wide-reaching for Canadians with a variety of health conditions.",56,MALE,N/A,N/A

In addition to obesity, other metabolic risk factors such as raised lipids, high blood pressure and diabetes increase pregnancy related complications such as preeclampsia and long term problems such as heart diseases, stroke and death. Preeclampsia, presenting as hypertension and proteinuria is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. Interventions that reduce cardiovascular events by modifying risk factors also have the potential to reduce the risk of preeclampsia. The investigators work funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) in the UK showed that dietary interventions in obese pregnant women may reduce the risk of preeclampsia. The investigators propose to show that pregnant women with metabolic risk factors derive the most benefit from a simple, targeted intervention based on Mediterranean dietary pattern to reduce the risk of maternal and fetal complications . Women with the risk factors (1230 women) will be randomly allocated to dietary intervention or usual antenatal dietary advice and the risk of maternal and fetal complications will be evaluated. The remaining eligible women who are consented for lipid tests, but do not have metabolic risk factors, will be followed up for outcome data only. Diet based interventions, especially those based on a Mediterranean dietary pattern has a potential to reduce the risk of preeclampsia. In the investigators study, pregnant mothers with risk factors will be randomly allocated to either a dietary invention or usual antenatal care and they will assess their composite maternal (pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes) and fetal (stillbirth, small for gestational age or admission to neonatal intensive care unit) outcomes.

For a long time it had been assumed that the choroid is a strictly passive vascular bed, which shows no autoregulation. However, recently several groups have identified some autoregulatory capacity of the human choroid. In the brain and the retina the mechanism behind autoregulation is most likely linked to changes in transmural pressure. In this model arterioles change their vascular tone depending on the pressure inside the vessel and outside the vessel. In the choroid, several observations argue against a direct involvement of arterioles. However, the mechanism behind choroidal autoregulation remains unclear.

NCT03317873,['Iron Metabolism Disorders'],2017-11-01,2019-02-19,"Iron deficiency is considered the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide and affects children and women in both non-industrialized as well as industrialized countries. The main regulatory molecule of iron metabolism is hepcidin, a hormone produced in the liver that regulates intestinal iron absorption, placental transport, recycling of iron by macrophages and release from stores. The expression of hepcidin is regulated by many mediators, one of which is Matriptase-2 - a transmembrane protease. Complete loss of function leads to the rare disease iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA). Matriptase-2 is encoded by the gene TMPRSS6 and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs855791 causes a non-synonymous substitution (V736A) that reduces the activity of the protease to inhibit hepcidin transcription. Genome wide association studies have identified the TMPRSS6 SNP rs855791 has a strong association with red blood cell and iron parameters in the general population.

The objectives of the study is to measure oral iron absorption and systemic iron utilization into red blood cells (RBC) using oral isotopic labels in subjects homozygotes for common variants of the TMPRSS6 gene with the SNP rs855791 (A736V); AA vs. VV subjects.

Until a few years ago, the study of training, loads, volumes and work intensities were the focus of attention, but nowadays, expanding towards recovery of the individual and consequently to an improvement of the assessments and treatments from the point of view of the alteration of the movement. Impaired motor control is a consequence of most central nervous system (CNS) movement disorders, such as cerebral palsy. A common physical examination includes assessment of passive muscle elongation endurance, isometric and isotonic testing. This test is used to judge the degree and nature of muscle hyperendurance, to determine etiology at the muscle tissue and/or motor control level, and to infer consequences for overall motor performance in functional tasks. Although this physical examination is in widespread clinical use and provides clinically essential information, it is still a subjective assessment and depends on several factors such as intra- and inter-examiner variability.this variability and subjectivity calls for a consensus on the interpretation and measurement of muscle neurophysiological responses in patients with neurological diseases.Generally, the assessment instruments used for the analysis of hypertonia in adapted sports are based on standardized tests and trials. Specifically, in CP (Cerebral Palsy)-Football, hypertonia is assessed by the degrees of spasticity of the modified Ashworth Scale. There is a need for instrumental assessment to validate subjectivity and thus facilitate the applicability, objectivity, characterization and monitoring of the pathology, such as surface electromyography (EMS).

NCT03726931,['Breast Cancer'],2018-11-13,2023-01-29,"Accurate staging is of great importance in patients with clinically locally advanced primary breast cancer (LABC, stage III) or locoregional recurrent (LRR) breast cancer for making a correct treatment plan. According to current guidelines, staging is performed with positron emission tomography (PET) using the 2-\[18F\]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (\[18F\]FDG) PET tracer, combined with diagnostic computed tomography (CT). However, previous studies have shown that this technique (with the current PET tracer) might not be sufficient for accurate staging. Specifically in low grade, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer metastases can be missed due to the low metabolic activity, leading to low uptake of \[18F\]FDG. Therefore, there is a clinical need to improve staging procedures. 16α-\[18F\]-fluoro-17β-estradiol (\[18F\]FES), an ER-targeted PET tracer, allows imaging of ER+ tumor lesions regardless of their metabolic activity. Patients with clinically LABC and LRR have a 25-50% risk of distant metastases. Correct identification of distant metastases allows adaptation of the treatment plan to avoid burdensome treatment with surgery, systemic and radiotherapy in order to maintain quality of life. In case of oligometastases, correct identification increases the likelihood for cure with local treatment. In the current study we will compare disease staging with \[18F\]FES- and \[18F\]FDG PET in patients with clinically LABC/LRR breast cancer. Objective: To determine whether \[18F\]FES PET/CT improves staging for women with clinically LABC or LRR, ER+/HER2- breast cancer as compared to standard \[18F\]FDG PET/CT. Study design: Multicenter prospective study with invasive measurements. Study population: 20 LABC and 20 LRR ER+/HER2- breast cancer patients. Main study parameters/endpoints: To determine the percentage of patients with a correctly changed treatment plan according to information obtained from \[18F\]FES PET/CT compared to \[18F\]FDG PET/CT at staging and at 6 months of follow-up; to determine the percentage of metastatic lesions detected and missed with \[18F\]FES PET/CT compared to \[18F\]FDG PET/CT (at staging and during follow-up). Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Patients will receive an intravenous cannula for tracer injection and blood sampling, causing potentially transient discomfort at the site of the cannula insertion. Tumor biopsy will be performed from an easy accessible lesion and the most frequent complications that can occur are discomfort, bleeding and (local) infection. The risk of complications from a tumor biopsy is considered low: 0.24-1.6% and 0.11-0.48% for major complications and mortality, respectively. Radiation exposure from a \[18F\]FES PET and \[18F\]FDG PET scan usually ranges between 4-11 mSv and 7-8 mSv, respectively. Radiation exposure from a diagnostic CT scan ranges between 8-14 mSv. The total radiation burden is considered justifiable when compared to the information that can be obtained from this study, in this patient group with breast cancer. Imaging with \[18F\]FES PET may improve staging for patients with breast cancer as it may show tumor lesions that could not be identified with \[18F\]FDG PET, the current standard for staging. If this is the case, the initial treatment goal and intensity can be adjusted which can have beneficial effects for the patient.",40,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A

Parent knowledge of normal variation of infant crying and of the dangers of shaking a baby as well as their ability to cope with infant irritability are likely factors in their successful adjustment to parenthood and the prevention of this tragic act.

Purpose: Identify easily implementable interventions for economically disadvantaged mothers in the newborn period which 1) Promote early literacy behaviors and early nurturing parent-child relationships and 2) Increase mother's knowledge of normal crying patterns, the dangers of shaking a baby and her ability to cope with parenting stresses.

Design/Methods: A convenience sample of 300 low income (insured by Medicaid) new mothers of healthy singleton, full term infants in the level 1 mother/baby unit at Women \& Infants Hospital will be invited to participate in a Randomized Controlled Trial study of educational videos and materials for parents. They will be randomized into one of two intervention groups. 1) The Ready to Learn (RTL) arm will receive a DVD in both Spanish and English and a bilingual booklet (both produced by Parents' action for Children) addressing the benefits of reading, talking and playing with young children, as well as a new children's board book. 2) The All Babies Cry (ABC) arm will receive a DVD in both, Spanish and English and a bilingual booklet (both produced by VIDA) explaining crying as part of normal infant behavior, highlighting signs of parental distress and providing strategies to sooth parents and their children. We will enroll 75 mothers who speak Spanish primarily at home in each intervention group, as well as 75 mothers who speak primarily English. The RTL mothers will serve as controls for the ABC mothers and vice versa. Before reviewing the materials, mothers will be asked to respond to a baseline interview with socio-demographic information, questions regarding Early Literacy promotion, reading with children and their own reading habits as well as general knowledge on the prevention of shaking a baby and handling their own stress. Follow up phone interviews will be conducted by a bilingual research assistant blind to the intervention status at 2-5 months post-partum containing similar questions.

Schizophrenia begins in young adulthood, and often is chronic and disabling for the remainder of the life course\], which is shorter than for the general population by as much as 25 years. The costs of schizophrenia in the United States are estimated to be between $30 and $60 billion dollars annually. Treatment for schizophrenia is only marginally successful: in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE), for example, the medication prescribed at the beginning of the trial was stopped or changed in nearly 75% by the completion of the trial 18 months later. The medications have limited effect on negative symptoms or cognitive impairments of schizophrenia, and many have severe and permanent side effects. The basic hypothesis underlying treatment for schizophrenia has not changed for more than half a century. New treatments are needed.

Much accumulating evidence suggests that sensitivity to gluten may be related to symptoms or etiology in schizophrenia and that gluten free diets may lead to significant symptom resolution, but only in patients who are known to have antibodies to gluten.

Gluten sensitivity may be more common than thought and stems from a different etiology and symptom presentation than Celiac Disease. The investigators analysis of the CATIE sample show that about 23% of persons with schizophrenia (compared to 3% of healthy controls) have Gluten Sensitivity (about 300,000 persons in the United States) through the identification of gliadin positive antibodies in their blood. The investigators hypothesize that people with this biomarker could have robust symptom improvements with the removal of the antigen from the diet (gluten). If only half of people with schizophrenia and these antibodies were to substantially benefit from removal of gluten from the diet, as in the case studies and with certain subjects in the clinical trials, this would provide a new transformative treatment option for an identifiable subpopulation of people with schizophrenia and would be of enormous benefit to patients, families and society. Another benefit to the public's health from this study will be enhanced knowledge of the etiology of schizophrenia, including possible linkages between neuropsychiatric disease and immune system activation, and identification of novel, immune-linked treatment targets.

The results of this research could lead to screening for Anti-Gliadin Antibodies early in life or at the first episode of schizophrenia, as recommended by some already. Screening involves financial and emotional costs, and better evidence is needed before this recommendation can be justified. Moreover, a new treatment paradigm of removing gluten from the diet by means of gluten blocking medications (already in early study) could advance treatment significantly.

This study will test the efficacy, in a pilot fashion, of 20 participants in a double blind five week randomized placebo controlled gluten free diet vs identical diet with gluten in gliadin-positive individuals with schizophrenia. Approximately equal numbers will receive the addition of gluten, or non-gluten starch, in identical form (given as flour in food). The investigators plan to develop mechanisms and procedures to locate, screen, and recruit subjects into the inpatient intervention study, retain them during the inpatient phase. Once admitted baseline assessments may take approximately a few days but will be mostly completed in the first week prior to the 5 week randomization, thus patients may stay longer than 5 weeks. At the end of the double blind trial the investigators will prepare for discharge and then test the feasibility of successfully maintaining gluten free diets after the intervention phase is complete, for at least two months.",26,MALE,18 Years,45 Years

NCT02346227,"['Uterine Cervical Dysplasia', 'Papillomavirus Infections']",2015-01,2018-08,"1. Introduction Cervical cancer (CC) is a major public health problem in Low-income countries (LICs), particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where the estimated number of cases is 3839 per year. (WHO, 2010).

   Persistent infection with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is recognized as the necessary cause for the development of CC. Thus, CC is a disease that is easily preventable primarily by vaccination against HPV and secondarily through screening and treatment of precancerous lesions of the cervix.

   In LICs, the high incidence of CC is due to both high rates of infection with HPV, a failure to initiate and sustain effective screening programs based on cytology and the non-availability of vaccination against HPV. These situations highlight the need to implement simple and inexpensive screening and treatment methods suitable for LICs. These methods include screening by visual inspection of the cervix after application of acetic acid (VIA) and treatment with a topical antiviral drug (AV2).
2. Aims

   This study aims to:
   * Evaluate the clinical efficacy of AV2 as a treatment for HPV-associated lesions of the uterine cervix;
   * Identify HPV genotypes found in Kinshasa;
   * Determine the cost-effectiveness of an algorithm combining screening by VIA and AV2 and that combining VIA and cryotherapy treatment;
3. Methods After basic training of local health workers on VIA, on collection of cervical samples for HPV testing (quantitative Polymerase Chain reaction, qPCR) and liquid-based cytology (LBC) and on application of AV2, a screening and treatment program will be offered to women aged 25 and older who will give their informed consent.

All women with lesions on VIA will be randomized into one of two groups to receive either treatment by AV2 or placebo.

All women with lesions on VIA will be monitored and reviewed after two months and after six months for repeat tests (VIA and LBC for lesions, qPCR for viral load, conversion and reinfection rates).",327,FEMALE,25 Years,N/A
NCT02237027,['Adherence to Medication Regime'],2014-10,2016-12,"In the last few years, early treatment of HIV-infected individuals, or ""treatment as prevention (TasP), and pre-exposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs among HIV-negative people at very high-risk of acquiring the infection (PrEP) have emerged as highly promising biological preventive interventions to tackle the HIV pandemic within the framework of combination prevention, a multi-component strategy that has been promoted for the last five years. In West Africa, the evidence strongly suggests that female sex workers (FSWs) contribute very disproportionally to the HIV spread. This is why the investigators propose this TasP and PrEP demonstration project in Benin, where our group has been involved in HIV prevention research in the sex work milieu for the last two decades.

After a run-in phase for community preparedness and the development of a specific education program on adherence, the investigators plan to recruit 100 HIV-infected FSWs in the TasP component of the project (these women will receive a first-line antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimen as per the Benin guidelines) and 250 HIV-negative FSWs in the PrEP component (these women will receive Truvada®). The recruitment period will last for one year, followed by an additional one year of follow-up, for a total follow-up period varying between 12 and 24 months, depending on when a given woman is recruited in the study. During follow-up visits every three months, the investigators will closely monitor treatment adherence and changes in sexual behaviour, including the use of viral load testing among TasP participants and Truvada® plasma level testing for PrEP participants, as well as detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and Y-chromosome DNA in vaginal fluids in all participants.

The investigators will evaluate the feasibility of TasP and PrEP through a set of indicators, including uptake, coverage, adherence, condom migration, occurrence of side effects and development of drug resistance, whereas mathematical modeling will be used to predict the potential impact of both interventions in the sex work milieu and the general population, based on the actual set of indicators observed. The study will be completed by an economic evaluation of the interventions and a cost-effectiveness analysis.

Finally, the investigators will disseminate the results to the study population and to the Beninese health authorities and ensure the broad implementation of these interventions in Benin if the demonstration project shows that they are feasible and relevant.",361,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A
NCT02948673,"['Type 2 Diabetes', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species Production']",2016-05,2017-12,"Objectives: The research focus of the study is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in response to glutathione (GSH) supplementation and in response to acute exercise.

Oxidative stress is suggested as a possible causative factor in the pathophysiology of skeletal muscle insulin resistance. GSH is the most abundant endogenous antioxidant in the cell and thus, a crucial protector against oxidative stress and insulin resistance. It has been found that patients with T2D have a decreased level of GSH in plasma and that 1 h GSH infusion improves skeletal muscle glucose uptake by \~25% and the redox environment in patients with T2D. Therefore, we want to investigate the effect of 3 months of GSH supplementation on skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial ROS production in patients with T2D and healthy controls.

Hypothesis: Oral GSH supplementation will improve skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in patients with T2D and this effect will be linked to a reduced mitochondrial ROS production in the skeletal muscle.

In contrast to the link between oxidative stress and insulin resistance, ROS produced in response to exercise is an important physiological stimulus as it is suggested to play a key role in the beneficial mitochondrial biogenesis observed in response to training. It has been reported that some patients with T2D have a diminished mitochondrial biogenesis in response to training, but the reason for this defect is not known. We want to investigate the link between exercise-stimulated ROS production and the mitochondrial biogenesis response in patients with T2D and healthy controls in response to acute exercise at two different intensities.

Hypothesis: Considering the pathological condition of T2D skeletal muscle (i.e. high chronic ROS level), we speculate that a lower exercise intensity, leading to a lower exercise-stimulated ROS production is a more optimal stimulus (i.e. not to high) for mitochondrial biogenesis in patients with T2D.",20,MALE,30 Years,50 Years

Recently, the European League Against Rheumatism presented evidence based recommendations for the management of the fibromyalgia. Accordingly, prompt diagnosis and patient education is required for optimal management. A graduated approach with the aim of improving health-related quality of life should be followed. It should focus ﬁrst on non-pharmacological modalities and the only ""strong for"" evidence-based recommendation was the use of aerobic and strengthening exercise. Aerobic exercise with moderate intensity (60 to 70% of age-adjusted predicted maximum heart rate (maxHR)) with a frequency of two or three times per week for at least 4 to 6 weeks for a reduction of symptoms is recommended in the management of fibromyalgia.

NCT03102476,['Type1diabetes'],2016-06,2018-02-02,"Type 1 Diabetes mellitus (T1D) is characterized by βcell destruction and a long life requirement of exogenous insulin. The bolus basal insulin regimen is a widely accepted therapy concept to treat hyperglycaemia in patients with T1D. This concept requires a very good knowledge of the individuals prandial and basal insulin requirements. However, insulin requirement depends on insulin absorption from the injection site and the individual's insulin sensitivity which relies on a number of effects including body composition, inflammatory processes and environmental factors. Climatic factors such as differences in air temperature could affect both, insulin absorption and insulin sensitivity as suggested by recent reports. For instance, it is reported that hot baths can accelerate the absorption of short acting but not of long acting insulin formulations from the subcutaneous depot. In addition, local warming of the injection site by a novel device (InsuPatch) results as well in an accelerated insulin action profile of short acting insulins. Moreover, Berglund et al. reported seasonal variations in insulin sensitivity in elderly men with increased insulin sensitivity during summer time.

Although an effect of temperature on insulin absorption and action can be assumed and was subject to current clinical trials, there is only little knowledge on the effect of humidity and the cumulative effect of humidity and temperature on insulin pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. For subjects with type 2 diabetes it was reported that accommodation to high temperatures and moist air of more than 75% is impaired compared to healthy subjects as determined by skin blood flow, temperature and moisture. Although it can be estimated that changes in blood flow due to hot and moist air affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of subcutaneous prandial insulins, to our knowledge no such study in subjects with T1D using the euglycaemic clamp technique was carried out yet.

Epidemiology studies suggest that this influence may be reduced by the diet of men at risk of getting prostate cancer. Although the exact nature of the effects of diet are not completely known, the amount of fat eaten appears to affect the number of men who get prostate cancer. The type of fat also seems to matter. Eating more of a type of fat called omega-3 polyunsaturated fat is associated with decreased prostate cancer risk. Omega-3 fat comes from fish and is quite different from the type of fat from animals and vegetables (omega-6 fat). Because the exact mechanism of this reduction in prostate cancer risk is not known, no blood test indications, called markers, have been discovered that would show the effect working.

Study doctors designed this study to try to find markers in the blood tests of men who have prostate cancer, and to find out if a diet supplemented with omega-3 type fat from fish oil helps reduce those markers, hence indicating that it helps reduce the cancer in these men. These men will be compared to men with prostate cancer whose diets do not contain the fish-oil fat.

Closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercises are defined as exercises in which the distal segment is stabilized by encountering significant resistance while the proximal segment moves. In contrast, open kinetic chain (OKC) exercises allow the distal segment to move freely without any resistance. Recently, the importance of closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercises has increased in enhancing shoulder joint neuromuscular control by improving dynamic shoulder stability and joint position sense.

The most current shoulder rehabilitation protocols include exercises for restoration of scapular muscle imbalances.There exist studies investigating the levels of scapular muscle activation during CKC exercises. Researchers have shown that most CKC exercises especially push-ups and plank variations with the shoulder in the 90° position, generally provide high SA activity and an optimal UT/SA ratio.In the literature, there is limited information on how the level of shoulder elevation affects scapular muscle activity and ratio during closed kinetic chain exercises in the prone position.

Postprandial factors (such as insulin) are perceived by the human brain and induce signals that regulate glucose metabolism via the parasympathetic nervous system.

Deep breathing exercise can increase parasympathetic nerve activity. Heart rate variability (HRV) in healthy people can be significantly increased by deep breathing maneuvers, indicating a shift from sympathetic activity to parasympathetic activity.

The hypothesis is that this postprandial shift results in a change in peripheral glucose metabolism. In turn, the increased parasympathetic activity could potentially result in a change in postprandial insulin sensitivity or secretion.

To test this hypothesis, this study investigates the effect of deep breathing exercise versus normal breathing on insulin sensitivity, on insulin secretion, glucose tolerance, resting energy expenditure, and on parasympathetic tone (analysis of heart rate variability).",16,MALE,18 Years,65 Years

Given the wide range of bodyweights of pregnant women in contemporary obstetric practice, it is critical to determine the minimum effective dose of TxA, so as to avoid under- or over-dosing. The rationale of this study is to determine the minimum effective dose of TxA that is required to attain therapeutic plasma levels of TxA, established at 5-15mg/L, following administration of a single dose of intravenous (IV) TxA after childbirth and the clamping the umbilical cord, and before delivery of the placenta. Following birth of the infant, and upon clamping the umbilical cord, the investigators will administer a single dose of IV TxA in 100ml of 0.9% sodium chloride at 50mg/min according to the dose-escalation schedule described below. The slow rate of infusion has been chosen to prevent untoward effects such as hypotension that have been noted when the rate of infusion has exceeded 100mg/min. As part of the dose-escalation design, the investigators will start with 5mg/kg, half the smallest described dose, on a sample of up to 5 women.

These tumors may cause bleeding, pelvic pain and pressure. Because fibroids grow in the presence of estrogen, medical therapies that decrease estrogen levels (like GnRH analog) cause fibroids to shrink and so may relieve symptoms. However, such medication can only be given short-term and has inconvenient side effects such as hot-flushes. Thus, many women with symptomatic fibroids choose to have them removed surgically, either individually or by removing the uterus via hysterectomy.

Currently, there is no level I evidence to support either Pfannenstiel or midline vertical skin incision in the prevention of wound complications in the obese patient undergoing cesarean section. Therefore, current practice is for the surgeon to make the decision based on preference and weighing theoretic risks. Therefore, there is clinical equipoise.

Similar to the beneficial health effects after performing conventional continuous exercise modalities, high intensity interval training (HIIT) has been reported as an effective alternative exercise-modality to improve glucose homeostasis in both prediabetes subjects and individuals with T2D diagnosed. In this regard, although multiple HIIT-based interventions commonly report acute and long term benefits on body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness and insulin sensitivity in metabolically compromised subjects, little is known about the acute cardiovascular response (i.e., at heart rate level) during HIIT in subjects with different glucose control.

HIIT is described as performing brief periods of exercise at vigorous or maximal intensity, interspersed with inactive or low intensity recovery phases of variable duration. In order to characterize different HIIT-based protocols, exercise intensity is usually defined as relative percentages of individual maximal cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) or relative maximal power output values. Nevertheless, the need for specific technological equipment to assess these parameters usually limit the prescription and recommendations of HIIT in clinical settings and other public health contexts at massive level. Additionally, the use of self-perceived exertion scales and heart rate (HR) variations upon HIIT have been demonstrating to be accessible and feasible strategies to regulate exercise intensity during HIIT. For example, it was reported that HR and self-perceived exertion scores increased progressively in T2D subjects, parallel to the oxygen consumption rate throughout an acute HIIT session performed on cycle ergometer. Consequently, it is conceivable to hypothesize that determining HR variations during HIIT might optimize the recommendation of this training methodology in metabolically compromised subjects as those at risk or with T2D diagnosed. Therefore, the aim of the present study was To describe and compare the acute heart rate changes in response to an incremental maximal exercise test and a single HIIT session between normoglycaemic (NG), prediabetes (Pre-T2D) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) subjects.",75,FEMALE,18 Years,60 Years

VD deficiency results in impaired reproductive performance in various species of animals, and recently the investigators have shown that the VD receptor (VDR), activating (CYP2R1, CYP27A1, CYP27B1) and inactivating (CYP24A1) enzymes are expressed in the human testis, epididymis, seminal vesicle, prostate and spermatozoa. Our following functional studies showed that VD increases intracellular calcium in mature spermatozoa, and hence may be important not only for spermatogenesis but also for sperm maturation. A new, and yet unpublished cross sectional study of 300 young healthy Danish men showed that men with lower levels of serum VD have significantly lower number of normally developed and motile spermatozoa. Hitherto, most cases of male infertility have been classified as ""idiopathic"", and infertile couples have been referred to symptomatic treatment at infertility clinics. These fertility treatments are often physically demanding for the female partner as well as expensive for the health care system. Any treatment that might improve semen quality of involuntary infertile men would be beneficial both for the infertile couples and the society in general. Our findings that VD may play a role for human semen quality have not yet been tested clinically. However, if VD supplementation proves efficient this opens for the first time for a causal, safe and cheap treatment of at least some cases of ""idiopathic"" impaired semen quality. The investigators believe our new human data supported by the results from the VD deficient and VDR KO animal studies and the high proportion of VD deficient Danish men provide sufficient evidence to initiate a randomized clinical trial of VD supplementation to infertile men. Infertile men have also have unfavorable altered levels of sex hormones and higher mortality than fertile men.

In the United States (U.S.) in 2014, more than 230,000 women were diagnosed and 40,000 died of breast cancer. There is an urgent need to develop acceptable means of preventing breast cancer both for high risk and average risk women.

The proposed study is a clinical trial in premenopausal women aged 18-39 to evaluate the capacity of daily Ulipristal Acetate (UPA) to reduce breast epithelial cell proliferation (increase in number of cells in the breast) and to measure its effect compared to that found with a combined estrogen-progestin oral contraceptive (COC). UPA is an anti-progestin in use as daily medication up to 12 months for the treatment of abnormally heavy bleeding at menstruation due to uterine fibroids, and is currently in trials in the U.S. to evaluate its use as a daily contraceptive.

The investigators will use breast biopsies to compare breast cell proliferation, comparing biopsies at the end of 3 months treatment to biopsies taken at baseline in the 2 groups (UPA and COC). The investigators will also compare the changes in the 2 groups to each other. The comparison of the effect of UPA to that of a conventional COC is because of UPA's potential use as a daily contraceptive.

Cell proliferation in the breast occurs throughout the menstrual cycle. The actions of hormones on the breast are rapid and an anti-progestin such as UPA, which will block the action of progesterone in the breast, would be predicted to quickly lower breast cell proliferation in premenopausal women. Effects of UPA on the uterus continue to be studied and are reassuring. COC use has not been found to lower breast cell proliferation and is not associated with any decrease in risk of breast cancer.

It appears to be an important molecule that is involved in limiting the pathogenesis of obesity-linked disorders and may have potential benefits as a marker to evaluate the effect of possible interventions on the MetS components and its complications.

Metformin is treatment of choice in patients with MetS, due to its low cost and pharmacological comparable effects with thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone), it decreases hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, free fatty acids and triglycerides, it produces as well, a moderate weight loss, improves lipid profile and delays the appearance of diabetes mellitus in subjects with an abnormal fasting glucose.

A second choice to lower the risks would be the addition of a fiber like inulin, a prebiotic, since it has demonstrated metabolic benefits on lipid and carbohydrates metabolism by several mechanisms proposed such as induction of lipogenic enzymes by glucose, production of short-chained fatty acids, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and growth of Bifidobacterium.

Dietary saturated fat is recognised as the main dietary component responsible for raising blood LDL-cholesterol, and reducing its intake has been the mainstay of dietary guidelines for the prevention of heart disease for over 30 years. However, there is very little evidence for a direct link between the intake of saturated fat and risk of dying from heart disease. One explanation for this, is that the link between saturated fat intake and heart disease is not a direct one, but relies heavily on the ability of saturated fat to raise blood LDL-cholesterol levels. This LDL cholesterol-raising effect of saturated fat is complex, and highly variable between individuals because of differences in the metabolism of dietary fat and cholesterol between people.

Avoiding along, protracted labor entails shorter exposure to pain, anxiety and stress and would thus translate into a major improvement in maternal satisfaction with the childbirth experience.

Based on the premise that shortening the length of labor is beneficial, interventions aimed at accelerating the progression of labor have been introduced routinely as part of standard labor management and care throughout the 20th century. Certain labor accelerative procedures, such as amniotomy, became common practice and have been put to the acid test of randomized control trials to evaluate their efficacy. Use of anticholinergics/antispasmodics as a method of augmenting labor was ﬁrst described in 1937 by Hirsch, who reported a decrease in labor length by two to four hours following Intrapartum administration of an atropine-like drug (Syntropan®)mainly among older nulliparas.

Drotaverine, an isoquinolone derivative is a superior smooth muscle relaxant which acts specifically on spastic sites and corrects the cAMP and calcium balance relieving smooth muscle spasm.

This inhibitory action is detected only in lower uterine segment during labor since muscle fibers in upper uterine segment are strongly affected by contractile effect of oxytocin. Use of drotaverine during pregnancy is free of any teratogenic and embryotoxic effects.

Fifty to 100 percent of ACL injured females will suffer osteoarthritis of the injured knee within one to two decades of the injury. External knee abduction moment (LOAD) predicts ACL injury with high sensitivity and specificity in female athletes. Control of lateral trunk motion (LTM) also predicts ACL injury with similar levels of sensitivity and specificity in female athletes. These predictors may be linked, as lateral positioning of the trunk can create high knee abduction load via both biomechanical and neuromuscular mechanisms. The mechanism of ACL injury in females include high knee LOAD and high LTM, with the majority of body weight shifted over the injured limb and the foot positioned lateral to the body's center of mass. An unanticipated perturbation is also often a contributor to the injury mechanism. LTM may result in increased knee LOAD by increasing the lateral position and magnitude of the GRF vector (ΔGRFv) or by increasing reactive hip adductor torque (HAdT). Our long-term objectives are to determine the mechanisms that cause ACL injury in female athletes and to develop neuromuscular training (NMT) interventions that specifically target these mechanisms.

NCT04648566,['Infertility'],2017-03-22,2020-02-01,"One of the most limiting factors in the field of assisted reproduction is implantation failure. A new approach to increase the chances of success involves the use of cells from the patient's blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), which once isolated can be cultured for a few days and then inseminated back into the uterine cavity prior to embryo implantation. It has been shown that the immune system plays a major role in the process of embryo implantation. To date, at least three international clinical trials appear to confirm the usefulness of intrauterine administration of PBMC in the setting of repeated implantation failure (RIF) in in vitro fertilization (IVF) (RIF: absence of active pregnancy after ≥ 3 embryo transfers). The clinical pregnancy rate would be doubled or even tripled. This treatment has never been studied in a randomized double-blind clinical trial, in the context of fertilization without RIF or in a classic treatment such as intrauterine insemination (IUI) with the partner sperm.

Our hypothesis is that the creation of an endometrial inflammatory reaction by the administration of PBMC in the uterine cavity allows a better receptivity and consequently a better implantation following an embryo transfer as part of an IVF treatment.

The objective is to evaluate whether intrauterine administration of PBMC improves embryo implantation following assisted reproduction treatment.

The investigators plan to recruit 148 women undergoing IVF and 220 patients undergoing UII with partner sperm to test our hypothesis. The investigators also plan to recruit all RIF patients accepting to participate in the clinical trial. The study will be prospective, randomized and double-blind. The treated group will receive an intrauterine administration of PBMC while the control group will be administered with sperm washing medium only. PBMC will be obtained from a blood sample (maximum 10 ml) a few days before embryo transfer in IVF cases or on the day of sperm insemination in IUI cases. PBMC will then be isolated in the laboratory on a Ficoll gradient in order to eliminate platelets, polynuclear cells and red blood cells. PBMCs will then be stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG) for 48 hours. Lymphocyte phenotyping will be assessed before and after cell activation. In addition, the cytokine profile will be established from the supernatant of the stimulated cells. These data will make it possible to establish a link between the pro-versus anti-inflammatory cytokine profile and implantation success versus failure for each patient.

Embryo transfer will be performed in the same way as the standard treatment on day 3 or 5 according to the criteria established by the IVF laboratory and in agreement with the doctor.",423,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A

NCT00697957,['Osteoporosis'],2002-05,2003-06,"Ageing populations have made osteoporosis and fragility fractures a major public health concern worldwide. Half of all women and 30% of all men will suffer a fracture related to osteoporosis during their lifetime. While medical prevention of this immense problem is impossible at population level, it is necessary to find efficient preventive strategies. Exercise is one of the major prevention approaches because one reason behind the increasing burden of osteoporosis is the modern sedentary lifestyle. However, the optimal type, intensity, frequency, and duration of exercise that best enhances skeletal integrity are still largely unknown.

We conducted a 12-month population-based randomized controlled exercise intervention in 120 premenopausal women. The aim was to investigate the effect of impact exercise on bone mineral density, geometry and metabolism in healthy women with the intention of assessing the intensity and amount of impact loading with a novel accelerometer-based measurement device. Training effects on risk factors of osteoporotic fractures, physical performance and risk factors of cardiovascular diseases were also evaluated.

This study demonstrated that 12 months of regular impact exercise favoured bone formation, increased bone mineral density in weight-bearing bones, especially at the hip, and led to geometric adaptations by increasing periosteal circumference. Bone adaptations had a dose- and intensity-dependent relationship with measured impact loading. Changes in proximal femur were threshold-dependent, indicating the importance of high impacts exceeding acceleration of 4 g as an osteogenic stimulus. The number of impacts needed to achieve this stimulation was 60 per day. Impact exercise also had a favourable effect on physical performance and cardiorespiratory risk factors by increasing maximal oxygen uptake, dynamic leg strength and decreasing low-density lipoproteins and waist circumference. Changes were dose-dependent with impact loading at wide intensity range.

Bone adapts to impact loading through various mechanisms to ensure optimal bone strength. The number of impacts needed to achieve bone stimulation appeared to be 60 per day, comparable to the same number of daily jumps. If done on a regular basis, impact exercise may be an efficient and safe way of preventing osteoporosis.",120,FEMALE,35 Years,40 Years

NCT01601366,['Adenomyosis'],2012-04,2013-04,"Adenomyosis is a disease entity diagnosed when endometrial glands and stroma deep in the myometrium are associated with surrounding myometrial hypertrophy. The finding classically associated with adenomyosis is excessive uterine bleeding accompanied by worsening dysmenorrhea. The advent of endovaginal US has substantially improved the ability to diagnose adenomyosis. Different US features of adenomyosis have been reported, including uterine enlargement not explainable by the presence of leiomyomas, asymmetric thickening of the anterior or posterior myometrial wall, lack of contour abnormality or mass effect, heterogeneous poorly circumscribed areas within the myometrium, anechoic lacunae or cysts of varying sizes, and increased echotexture of the myometrium.

Transvaginal power Doppler application is useful in studying the vascular tree of adenomyosis and can aid clinicians in planning the most appropriate therapeutic strategy. The differential diagnosis using power Doppler sonography is based on vascular characteristics. Adenomyosis is characterized by a preserved vascular texture supply that results in dilated spiral arteries running perpendicular toward the myometrium into the endometrial surface. Leiomyomata exhibits a vascular tree that typically circumscribes the solid mass. 2D transvaginal power Doppler angiography should be used to improve diagnostic sensitivity and facilitate appropriate therapeutic intervention.

The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS), Mirena, has been approved in Europe for contraception since 1990. Because of the suppressive effect of levonorgestrel on the endometrium, Mirena has also been proven to be effective for the management of menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea, and as a progestin component in postmenopausal hormone therapy. It was introduced in Taiwan in 1995 as an alternative therapy for idiopathic menorrhagia. Many cases of menorrhagia are caused by adenomyosis, and Mirena was, therefore, introduced for the treatment of adenomyosis in Taiwan.

NCT02672566,['Fetal Growth Retardation'],2016-07-22,2019-09-05,"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is correlated to an abnormal placenta development, with an alteration of the maternal-fetal circulation, coagulation troubles, and apparition of placental infarcts. IUGR represents the third cause of perinatal mortality in France, and is associated to an important morbidity. For birth-weights \< 10th percentile of the gestational age, the neonatal death risk is doubled, compared to abnormal weights. In 35% of cases, IUGR is of vascular origin and is included in the broader framework of placental vascular pathology (PVP).

Up to now, studies have focused on the primary or secondary prevention of PVP. Few studies have evaluated the treatment of constituted vascular IUGR. Currently, the management of vascular IUGR is mainly based on active surveillance, or termination of pregnancy. Pathological findings suggest that placental pro-thrombotic phenomena play a role in the constitution of vascular IUGR. Since aspirin is not effective in reducing this type of event, a randomized, open-label study conducted in China compared 14-day treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) versus Dan-Shen (a product not used in France) after diagnosis of IUGR. This trial, including 73 patients, showed a significant improvement in average growth kinetics in the LMWH group. The mean birth weight was 2877 g in the heparin group and 2492 g in the Dan-Shen group (p \<0.0001). However, no data were provided concerning the number of newborns with a birth weight \<10th percentile, i.e. the risk of morbidity and mortality, or complications occurring. Due to the lack of reliable data, LMWH are not included in the currently recommended therapeutic strategy for vascular IUGR.

The studies in IUGR reported to date mainly focused on primary or secondary prevention in women at risk of PVP, assessing the value of aspirin, which showed only a modest effect. No effective therapeutic strategy is available to treat patients with constituted vascular IUGR, a situation where LMWH should be more effective than antiplatelets given the vascular context.",82,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A

The hypothesis is that the paravertebral block, in combination with a general anesthetic will reduce both pain scores and the amount of strong pain killers (opioids) that is needed. This will reduce the side effects of the pain killers such as nausea and vomiting.

This will be assessed by comparing it a general anesthetic with pain killers given through the intravenous (IV) as is routine practice. Patients requiring breast cancer surgery, who agree to be involved in the trial, will be randomly allocated into two groups: both groups will receive a block, then a standardised and optimised general anesthetic. In one group however the block is simply a small injection under the skin (a sham block), whereas the other group will receive a proper paravertebral block prior to this. Both groups will receive opioids as necessary, depending on both their bodies reaction during the surgery and their pain scores when they wake up.

The paravertebral block is a very safe procedure with a very low side effect profile, and many studies have shown a benefit in breast cancer surgery. The investigators would like to assess this in our own practice. The block is normally inserted under some light sedation, with freezing into the skin initially. It is normally very well tolerated.

NCT00812526,['Autoregulation'],2002-09,2004-09,"Autoregulation is the ability of a vascular bed to maintain blood flow despite changes in perfusion pressure. For a long time it had been assumed that the choroid is a strictly passive vascular bed, which shows no autoregulation. However, recently several groups have identified some autoregulatory capacity of the choroid. Choroidal autoregulation was first shown in a rabbit model where intraocular pressure (IOP) and arterial blood pressure could be varied independently. In these experiments regulation of choroidal blood flow was not only dependent on ocular perfusion pressure, but was also dependent on the value of IOP. This indicates that a myogenic mechanism contributes to choroidal autoregulation, because the regulatory capacity is dependent on the transmural pressure. In the model of myogenic autoregulation arterioles change their vascular tone depending on the pressure inside the vessel and outside the vessel. The present experiments are designed to test whether a myogenic mechanism may also be involved in choroidal autoregulation in humans. For this purpose the investigators perform experiments during which the IOP and the arterial blood pressure is increased.

All participants were free from severe psychiatric illnesses, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, alcoholic fatty liver disease, hyperthyroidism, or hypothyroidism. Inclusion criteria required participants to be non-smokers, not currently on any diet pills, and have no history of cardiovascular or metabolic diseases.

Randomization and Intervention Fifty eligible participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=25) or the control group (n=25). The intervention group underwent a 6-hour daily TRF from noon to 6 P.M., while the control group did not participate in TRF but maintained their usual eating patterns. No restrictions were placed on the type or quantity of food consumed by participants in either group.

Data Collection and Measures Body Composition and Anthropometry: Measurements included body mass index, body fat percentage, muscle mass, hydration levels, protein content, and visceral fat, all assessed using a bioelectrical impedance analysis scale (Mi Body Composition Scale 2 by Huami Technology). Waist circumference was manually measured by experienced nurses using a tape measure.

Blood Pressure and Heart Rate: These vital signs were monitored using an arm cuff electronic blood pressure monitor (Panasonic EW3153), with the arm positioned at heart level to ensure accuracy. Measurements were taken after at least five minutes of seated rest.

Nutritional Intake Although time-restricted feeding interventions do not usually change the content or quantity of dietary intake, the total daily intakes of energy, fat, protein, carbohydrate, cholesterol, and fibre were calculated using the Nutritionist Pro food analysis program.

NCT01014026,"['Uterine Cervical Neoplasms', 'Uterine Cervical Dysplasia']",2009-09,2011-03,"Scientific Context

High-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) are the causative agents for cervical cancer. Cervical cancer screening strategies rely on periodic Papanicolaou (Pap) testing. It's well-known that this test has significantly contributed to the reduction of mortality and morbidity due to cervical cancer. In France, it now seems that the screening strategy could be optimized. The two main ways are to reach the 7 million underscreened women (mass screening, self-sampling for HPV DNA testing) and to improve the screening test (HPV DNA testing, computer-assisted cytology). Self-collected vaginal samples (SCVS) for HPV DNA testing could be a relevant screening option: this technique appears reliable and it could allow to reach women who are never or seldom screened. Currently, there is no French data on the SCVS for HPV DNA testing.

The goal of this study is to determine the performance and acceptability of a population-based strategy using self-collected vaginal samples for HPV DNA testing to reach women who are not participating in cervical cancer screening.

Description of the project

This project (APACHE-1) is a part of a project called APACHE. APACHE-1 will be dedicated to the SCVS technical validation and to the comparison between different transports medium. Nine hundred women will be recruited from the 20 to 65 years consultants in the Tours University Hospital (CHRU of Tours) and in the IRSA (health centre for routine medical checkup).

Each woman will collect 2 SCVS with a nylon flocked swab (Copan® microRheologics™). The first SCVS will be put in a vial which contains a liquid medium. The second SCVS will be put in a dry vial. Then during the speculum examination the physician will collect a cervical sample with a Rovers® Cervex-Brush™ and then rinse it into a vial containing PréservCyt ™. A blind HPV DNA testing and genotyping (Inno-LIPA HPV Genotyping ™ Extra) will be performed in the virology laboratory of the CHRU of Tours on all samples (SCVSs and cervical samples performed by a physician). The performance of the SCVS to detect cervical HPV infection will be assessed (gold standard test = HPV DNA testing on cervical samples collected by the physician).

In a second time (APACHE-2), the researchers will investigate to what extent offering home obtained SCVS leads to participation of unscreened women. APACHE-2 will be registered on Clinicaltrials as another project.",734,FEMALE,20 Years,65 Years

Once reperfusion is achieved in acute myocardial infarction, an intense inflammatory cascade is unleashed.

The architecture of the left ventricle rearranges, leading to ventricular remodeling. The ""homing process""involves stem cell migration to the sites of injury or ischemia, which provides an environment that is favorable to growth and function. This microenvironment is a stimulus for homing and differentiation of stem cells of the appropriate lineage. It increases vascular permeability and expression of adhesion proteins like integrin, along with homing receptors that facilitate the attachment, which is mediated by cell-to-cell contact and chemoattractant release from local tissue injury.The migratory capacity of stem cells might be dependent on natural growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) , stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)and stem cell factor (SCF).The expression of VEGF ,SDF-1 and SCF is highly up-regulated in hypoxic tissue, supporting the hypothesis that these factors may represent homing signals crucial to the recruitment of circulating progenitor cells to assist the endogenous repair mechanisms in the infarcted tissue.

NCT01890876,['Diabetes'],2013-06,2014-12,"Concentric (CE) and eccentric (EE) exercises may differently affect glucose metabolism which may be additionally modified when exercises are performed in hypoxia, e.g. at moderate (1500 - 2500 m) or high (2500 - 3500 m) altitudes. However, data on the effects of glucose metabolism due to CE and EE in hypoxia are scarce but would be of utmost importance considering the increasing number of persons suffering from impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes and the unique opportunities provided by the mountainous regions of the Alps to perform CE (e.g. uphill hiking) and EE (downhill hiking, downhill skiing) at altitude between 1500 - 3500 m. Metabolic responses to exercise may be largely mediated by interleukin 6 (IL-6), which is predominantly derived from the contracting limbs and may support the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis during exercise. In addition, IL-6 is elevated with acute and chronic altitude exposure at least partly mediated via adrenergic stimulation. Thus, the type of exercise as well as hypoxia may contribute to IL-6 elevations and differences in serum IL-6 concentrations might help to explain distinctions between responses of glucose metabolism to CE and EE at low and moderate to high altitude.

32 male subjects suffering from pre-diabetes will be randomly assigned to a downhill (EE) or uphill (CE) walking group performing 9 sessions at low altitude (860 - 1360 m) and 9 sessions at moderate to high altitude (2000 - 2500 m).

Measurements of glucose metabolism, IL-6 plasma concentration will be performed pre, mid (day 5) and post intervention. Moreover anthropometric, strength and exercise capacity characteristics will be performed pre and post intervention.

We hypothesize that EE in hypoxia is more effective in the modulation of glycemic control in pre-diabetic men than CE in hypoxia as well as EE and CE in normoxia. It is suggested that effects on glucose metabolism are associated with changes in plasma IL-6 concentrations. EE in hypoxia is expected to result in a more persistent rise of plasma IL-6 concentration than CE in hypoxia and in normoxia and to a more pronounced rise in plasma IL-6 than EE in normoxia.",32,MALE,50 Years,65 Years

NCT02529527,['Reproductive Health'],2015-09,2016-06-01,"Strong evidence supports that preconception care, or care to optimize a woman's health health prior to pregnancy, can improve birth outcomes. Preconception health counseling covers a broad range of topics, including: desire for pregnancy, obstetric history, nutrition, vaccinations, sexual health, chronic disease, substance abuse, mental health and contraception. Despite calls from public health organizations and experts in the field for universal access to preconception care, most US women do not receive any health counseling to prepare for pregnancy. Given that approximately half of US pregnancies are unintended, it is critical that routine primary care serve as a venue for the provision of this important service. From a patient's perspective, improving preconception health involves many health behavior changes. As such, patient engagement and education regarding preconception health must be a primary focus. Several preconception health promotion tools have been developed for patients to date; few are truly patient-centered and even fewer have been rigorously evaluated.

This study presents MyFamilyPlan - a novel, web-based, patient centered preconception health education tool designed for women of reproductive age receiving primary care. MyFamilyPlan is truly innovative in two key ways:

* MyFamilyPlan is a web-based preconception health self-assessment. This will allow for the employment of skip logic to individualize the questionnaire and subsequent health recommendations for each patient.
* Recognizing that preconception care is relevant to all women ""at risk"" of pregnancy, MyFamilyPlan has been designed for utilization in a primary care setting.

This preconception health education tool will be tested using a randomized controlled design. This study will measure whether or not exposure to MyFamilyPlan promotes the discussion of preconception health issues in primary care encounters (primary outcome). It will also evaluate whether the intervention affects participant self-efficacy in planning a healthy pregnancy, and relevant health behaviors (secondary outcome). The study proposed here will improve the quality of evidence for preconception health education tools. Should it demonstrate effectiveness, it will also result in a new tool that could be made more widely available to promote preconception health.",292,FEMALE,18 Years,45 Years

Therefore, maternal obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) is an indication for a detailed anatomic ultrasound examination. Ultrasound is a critical tool for the detection of congenital anomalies; however, obesity makes ultrasound examinations technically challenging.

The primary objective of this ambidirectional cohort pilot study is to evaluate whether utilization of a pannus retractor is associated with increased rates of detailed anatomic ultrasound completion amongst pregnant patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 40 kg/m2. Retrospective data will be collected for 100 patients with a BMI of 40 kg/m2 or greater to assess the baseline rate of completion of 16 components of the detailed anatomic survey prior to the intervention. We plan to enroll 20 patients into a prospective pilot to the intervention arm. The intervention is placement of an adhesive medical device, the traxi® Panniculus Retractor (Laborie, Portsmouth, New Hampshire), which was developed for pannus retraction during cesarean section. Adequacy of anatomic ultrasound completion will be based upon 16 pre-defined views from the anatomic survey. Ultrasound completion rates from the prospective cohort of participants that undergo ultrasound evaluation using a pannus retractor will be compared to a historical cohort without pannus retractor use. We hypothesize that use of a pannus retractor for pregnant participants with BMI greater than or equal to 40 kg/m2 increases the rate of anatomical ultrasound completion.",20,FEMALE,16 Years,N/A
NCT02429427,['Breast Cancer'],2005-12,2019-03,"It has been found that the chemical changes that take place in a patient's body during the development of inflammation may provide an environment which stimulates cancer cells. One step in the development of inflammation is the production of certain chemical substances which are important in the formation and spread of tumours. These are called prostaglandins. Cyclo-oxygenase II (COX-2) is an enzyme (a substance that speeds up chemical changes in the body) involved in the production of these prostaglandins and although it is not usually present in most tissues it is made at the sites of inflammation. Celecoxib is a selective Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) which works by blocking the action of the COX-2 enzyme, leading to a decrease in the production of prostaglandins and a reduction in inflammation.

The purpose of this study is therefore to find out if celecoxib can be used after breast cancer treatment (chemotherapy and/ or radiotherapy) to reduce inflammation and thus reduce the ability of new tumours to grow and survive.

2590 women with primary breast cancer will be recruited in this study from several locations in the United Kingdom and Germany. Eligible patients will be randomly allocated a treatment group, which can be celecoxib or placebo. Both treatments are taken orally (celecoxib 400mg daily, placebo 2 tablets daily) for a total of 2 years. In addition, hormone receptor positive patients will receive endocrine treatment as per local practice. Patients will prematurely discontinue treatment with celecoxib/placebo if disease progression is confirmed or if patients experience unacceptable toxicity.

Patients will be seen every 6 months for the first 3 years and then off treatment follow-up is carried out annually. Participating patients will also be given the option to take part in the pathology sub-study by donating a sample of the tumour tissue collected at the time of the primary surgery.",2639,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A

NCT01535976,['Hypoventilation'],2011-08,2013-05,"Procedures performed under sedation have the same severity in regards to morbidity and mortality as procedures performed under general anesthesia1. The demand for anesthesia care outside the operating room has increased tremendously and it poses, according to a closed claim analysis, major risks to patients . Both closed claim analysis identified respiratory depression due to oversedation as the main risk to patients undergoing procedures under sedation. The major problem is that hypoventilation is only detected at very late stages in patients receiving supplemental oxygen. Besides the respiratory effects of hypoventilation, hypercapnia can also lead to hypertension, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias and seizures.

The incidence of anesthetized patients with obstructive sleep apnea has increased substantially over the last years along with the current national obesity epidemic. These patients are at increased risk of hypoventilation when exposed to anesthetic drugs. The context of the massive increase in procedural sedation and the extremely high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea poses major respiratory risks to patients and it may, in a near future, increase malpractice claims to anesthesiologists. The development of safer anesthesia regimen for sedation are, therefore, needed. The establishment of safer anesthetics regimen for sedation is in direct relationship with the anesthesia patient safety foundation priorities. It addresses peri-anesthetic safety problems for healthy patient's. It can also be broadly applicable and easily implemented into daily clinical care.

Ketamine has an established effect on analgesia but the effects of ketamine on ventilation have not been clearly defined. The lack of validated and sensitive instruments to evaluate the effects of ketamine on ventilation is an important reason for the conflicting results.The investigators have demonstrated that the transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitor is accurate in detecting hypoventilation in patients undergoing deep sedation. Animal data suggest that when added to propofol in a sedation regimen, ketamine decreased hypoventilation when compared to propofol alone. It is unknown if ketamine added to a commonly used sedative agent (propofol) can decrease the incidence and severity of hypoventilation in patients undergoing deep sedation. It is also unknown if the effect of ketamine on ventilation are different in patients with and without obstructive sleep apnea.

The investigators hypothesized that patients receiving ketamine and propofol will develop less intraoperative hypoventilation than patients receiving propofol alone. The investigators also hypothesized that this effect will be even greater in patients with obstructive sleep apnea than patients without obstructive sleep apnea.

Significance: Respiratory depression due to oversedation was identified twice as the major factor responsible for claims related to anesthesia. The high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea combined with more complex procedures done in outpatient settings can increase physical risks to patients and liability cases to anesthesiologists. The main goal of this project is to establish the effect of ketamine in preventing respiratory depression to patients undergoing procedures under sedation. If the investigators confirm the their hypothesis , their findings can be valuable not only to anesthesiologist but also to other specialties ( Emergency medicine, gastroenterologists, cardiologists, radiologists) that frequently performed procedural sedation. The research questions is;does ketamine prevent hypoventilation during deep sedation? The hypotheses is; ketamine will prevent hypoventilation during sedation cases.",54,FEMALE,18 Years,64 Years

NCT03225976,['Athletes'],2018-01-25,2018-12-25,"Phototherapy is a therapeutic resource of increasing use in the last decade. The photobiomodulatory effects are commonly produced by means of low intensity lasers or LED emitting diodes, and can be used at different wavelengths. These light sources are divergent as to coherence, but produce equivalent tissue effects. The application of laser or LED light is able to induce biochemical changes in tissues, allowing for inhibitory or stimulating effects. These responses are associated to a cascade of cellular reactions, which favor the absorption of enzymes by cytochrome c oxidase, generating physiological responses that lead to decreased production of reactive oxygen species and increased synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The application of this therapeutic resource brings ergogenic and protective benefits in muscular performance. The use of LED as a light source is promising because of its low cost, but there are no enough studies that support this use in athletes, with a focus on performance improvement. In addition to the deficiency of the sample, there is also no consensus regarding the use of different wavelengths for LED in the literature, thus opening gaps for the best protocol for the application of this technique. Therefore, a study that evaluates the use of LED in athletes, with different wavelengths, to improve performance is necessary. Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that the LED application is capable of improving athletes performance in terms of increased fatigue resistance, increased strength and power, increased muscle recruitment, and optimized oxygen demand. It is also expected that the results generated in this study can contribute to and increase the resources used by physiotherapists within the clinical-sports field, contributing to the post-training recovery, as well as the more effective physical performance in competitive activities.",48,MALE,18 Years,45 Years

NCT03842527,['Cesarean Section'],2019-02-11,2020-02-28,"In recent years, human and animal studies have found that carbohydrate-loading prior to surgery leads to improved response to surgical stress and improved postoperative well-being when compared to traditional fasting guidelines. Such positive findings have lead to the increased use of preoperative intake of carbohydrate rich drinks prior to elective surgeries.

However, one of the biggest risks during surgery when a patient is asleep is having stomach contents come up into the lungs. For this reason, a stomach that is empty or has minimal amount of contents is safest. Historically, patients have been instructed not to eat or drink for 8 hours before surgery because it was thought to lower the risk of having fluid or contents in the stomach. This is the current practice patients are asked to follow before undergoing a C-section. However, non-pregnant patients undergoing other surgeries are instructed to have carbohydrate-rich drinks because of the potential benefits. Using ultrasound, the abdomen can be simply scanned to see if there are stomach contents present before surgery. This can allow for the potential determination of what the aspiration risk may be.

What the investigators want to do is look at the safety of using carbohydrate-loading in patients having a C-section. The investigators want to make sure that patients who follow carbohydrate-loading by having a clear, sugary drink 3 hours before a C-section are not at greater risk of having a large amount of stomach contents and be at higher risk of aspirating. This will be done by taking an ultrasound scan of the stomach that will tell the investigators if there are contents in the stomach and whether there is a risk of aspiration.

Patients having an elective C-section will be randomized into two groups. The first group will follow carbohydrate-loading by having a drink of apple juice or cranberry juice cocktail the night before (800mL) and 3 hours before (400mL) the C-section. The second group will follow standard practice of not eating or drinking less than 8 hours prior to surgery.

NCT03214276,['Healthy'],2012-01-01,2012-06-01,"Endurance performance during high intensive exercises is mainly determined by the capacity of the aerobic metabolism. It generally induces muscle fatigue defined as the reversible decline in skeletal muscle contractile performance. Fatigue is multifactorial and is often associated with many physiological parameters including reduced neural input and disruptive metabolic changes in skeletal muscles such as lactic acidosis and the production of oxidative free radicals. Moreover, it could lead to oxidative stress as a result of an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and intrinsic antioxidant defense.

To alleviate oxidative stress, some ergogenic strategies have been tested. Numerous studies have reported that different types of supplementation such as selenium, vitamin E, vitamin C or polyphenols were of interest to protect against these mechanisms. Indeed, although some studies demonstrated no or harmful effects, most studies observed positive effects of antioxidants on oxidative stress or performance. More particularly, polyphenols, have great antioxidant capabilities and protective effects and it increases the synthesis and bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO)which is well known to be the most important mediator of vasodilation. To date, most of the studies exploring the effects of polyphenols on exercise investigated several days or weeks of supplementations on vascular, blood parameters (blood pressure, NO concentration, oxidative stress markers) or endurance performance. Conflicting results are often obtained. Only few studies investigated the effects of a single intake on immediate performance and recovery capacity. Therefore, the present work aimed to study the effects of an acute intake of a specific profile polyphenols from grape and apple on physical performances. More specifically, performance, in the present study, referred to high intensity cycling exercise until exhaustion revealing the capacity to maintain a constant strong effort hereafter named endurance. The hypothesis was that an acute of polyphenols would increase the time to exhaustion during a high intensity cycling exercise.",48,MALE,25 Years,45 Years

Metformin hydrochloride extended release formulations have been developed to overcome these problems. In India, extended release formulations of metformin hydrochloride include metformin SR 1000mg tablet and combination of metformin hydrochloride SR 1000mg/glimepiride 2mg tablet. In the combination tablet, only metformin hydrochloride is in the extended release form. In view of the fact that extended release metformin hydrochloride is usually recommended with a meal, that food is known to affect the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of metformin and that there is a potential for dose dumping with extended release formulations that may lead to side effects similar to IR formulations, a study to estimate the magnitude of the food effect for these formulations in fed state compared to the fasting state is warranted. This study will be a randomized, single-center, open-label, single-dose, three-period, 6 sequence crossover study in 30 healthy adult volunteers to estimate the bioavailability of metformin from metformin hydrochloride 1000mg SR tablet given in fasting condition relative to metformin hydrochloride 1000mg SR tablet and a fixed dose combination of metformin hydrochloride 1000mg SR /glimepiride 2mg tablet, each given in fed condition.

NCT01780376,['Effects of Vibration'],2013-01,2013-01,"Whole Body Vibration (WBV) applies thrust force in opposite direction to gravity to body.This mechanical stimulation induces reflex muscular activity. Tonic vibration reflex (TVR) is most commonly cited mechanism to explain WBV-induced reflex muscular activity (WBV-IRMA), although there is no conclusive evidence that TVR occurs. The bone myoregulation reflex is another neurologic mechanism used to explain the effects of vibration on muscular performance.

Investigators hypothesized that latency of WBV-IRMA is different from latency of TVR. Primary aim of this study is to determine latency of WBV-IRMA. Secondary aim is to investigate whether WBV-IRMA is explained with TVR.

Twenty healthy young adult men are planned to include in this study. Participants will stand upright with their knees locked during WBV. PowerPlate Pro5 will be used for WBV. WBV with high amplitude at 25,30,35,40,45 and 50 Hz will be applied. Surface electrodes will be placed on both the soleus muscles. To measure TVR latency, piezo-electric accelerometer will be placed on the achilles tendon and this achilles tendon will be stimulated with spring based mechanical reflex hammer. Our pilot study was showed that motor unit potentials (MUAP) occurred in a 1:1 response with vibration. After confirmation of this finding, WBV-IRMA latency will be measured in the present study. To measure WBV-IRMA latency, piezo-electric force sensor will be placed between heel and WBV platform. Exact moment of initial strike of heel when thrust force expressed by WBV begin to be transferred to body will be determined. The time between moment of the initial strike and corresponding MUAP is defined as ""WBV-IRMA latency"".

NCT02495727,['Muscular Atrophy'],2015-07,2017-10,"Muscle size declines at around 0.5-1% per year after 50 years of age, with muscle strength declining up to twice as fast as muscle size. This may eventually lead to loss of independence if tasks of daily living become too strenuous to be performed safely. Short periods of bed rest cause very rapid loss of muscle size and strength, and studies using healthy older participants have shown that age increases vulnerability to this muscle loss. However, it is unlikely that healthy individuals would be faced with periods of bed rest unless suffering a severe illness. In light of this, recent evidence has shown that even just reducing walking to less than 1,500 steps per day for two weeks caused 4% loss of leg muscle in over 65 year olds. This amount of activity is roughly the equivalent of being housebound, something that may become more common into older age, for example due to prolonged bad weather, or minor injury or illness.

This study will investigate what causes such stark muscle loss during two weeks of reduced activity, and the impact on skeletal muscle function and size, as well as balance, body composition, and other indicators of general health such as how the body responds to food or exercise. Importantly, exercise strategies that could reduce muscle loss during a period of reduced activity will also be investigated.

In brief, three groups of 10 older men (aged 65-80 years) will undertake two weeks of reduced physical activity by limiting their daily steps to \<1,500/day. All groups will then undertake a re-training exercise programme to ensure that any losses in muscle strength or size are regained. One of the groups will be a control, whereby they will undertake the step-reduction intervention and re-training, but no protective exercise before or during the step-reduction intervention. This group will allow us to achieve our primary objective of determining the influence of two weeks of reduced physical activity on muscle strength and size in healthy older males. The two other groups will undertake either four weeks of strength exercise training before the step-reduction intervention, or daily home based exercise 'snacking' during the step-reduction intervention. The potential protective benefits of the exercise interventions in reducing the impact of two weeks of reduced activity on muscle strength and size, and any effect on how muscle is re-gained afterwards, will be compared to the 'control' group.",12,MALE,65 Years,80 Years

NCT05124327,"['Hypertensive Disorder of Pregnancy', 'Preeclampsia', 'Gestational Hypertension']",2022-03-07,2022-06-30,"The literature unequivocally supports follow-up in the postpartum period post hospital discharge in hypertensive patients, compared to uncomplicated delivery follow-up recommendations of 4-6 weeks postpartum, leading to decreased morbidity and mortality, utilizing at-home blood pressure monitoring and virtual/telemedicine appointments. There is much evidence that telemedicine visits are equally, if not more effective, result in cost savings, and are generally preferred by patients, specifically when there is a risk of exposure for the patient and newborn, an appropriate factor to consider amidst the global Covid-19 pandemic. Maternal health and well-being have substantial links with cultural and racial factors. Black women are three times as likely to have morbid outcomes related to gestational complications, specifically hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Minority populations have historically displayed inferior access to care due to concerns related to transportation, healthcare insurance, or provider accessibility and distrust, resulting in diminished compliance with follow-up and negative health sequelae.

Telemedicine follow-up within 10 days of delivery (48-72 hours after discharge) reduces readmission rates, increase access to- and compliance with care, and improve patient safety satisfaction, thus establishing feasibility. Home vital sign monitoring gives an increased volume of data points for providers to utilize in titrating antihypertensive medications to optimize blood pressure control, ultimately decreasing stroke and cardiovascular risk. Existing research lacks comprehension regarding specific cardiological impacts of labile postpartum blood pressures, however researchers inferentially hypothesize that poor blood pressure management in the postpartum period can have devastating long-term cardiological consequences.

This QI project will demonstrate standardized programming for patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), which may potentially lead to increased compliance, satisfaction, and accessibility, resulting in improved long-term cardiovascular health in vulnerable populations. The American heart Association (AHA) and ACOG have established that HDP are associated with long-term cardiovascular disease, however obstetricians lack guidance on effective, evidence-based research for standardization of care, leading to subsequently disjointed medical management with much room for error in transitioning from obstetrician to internist or cardiologist. Thus, implementing and establishing feasibility of remote monitoring and follow-up while applying standardized algorithms and protocols for antihypertensive medication titration and management may provide support in addressing and eradicating these gaps. As such, this pilot project has massive prospective future applicability and benefit for a highly vulnerable population.",30,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A

Black women are less likely than white women to develop breast cancer but, they are more likely to die of the disease. Some of this survival discrepancy is likely due to underuse of adjuvant therapies proven to increase survival. Breast cancer treatment often requires coordination among surgeons, pathologists, primary care physicians, medical and radiation oncologists. In NYC, black and Hispanic women who accessed care and underwent surgical treatment of their breast cancer were twice as likely as whites to experience underuse of adjuvant treatment. Disturbingly, 1/3 of these underuse cases were episodes in which the surgeon recommended treatment, the patient did not refuse and yet, care did not ensue. Underuse in such circumstances is attributable to system failures than to specific provider or patient factors.

It is also a very important factor in predicting nutritional status, health and development in childhood. It even influences health in adult life, contributing to the vicious cycle of disease and poverty. The high rate LBW in DCs represents therefore a major public health problem. Maternal chronic energy deficiency is assumed to be a major determinant of the problem in these countries along with prenatal micronutrient deficiencies. A large body of recent evidence points out that multiple micronutrient supplementation as such has only a modest beneficial effect on fetal growth. Therefore, it is expected that providing these multiple micronutrients in a food supplement covering energy requirement needs of pregnant women will have an effect of public health importance on children's health.

This study has the objective of improving children's health by improving birth outcome and fetal growth through the provision of a food supplement enriched in multimicronutrients during pregnancy.

NCT01740674,['Internet Data Collection'],2012-12,2014-11,"One of the biggest challenges of conducting research where the investigators follow people over a long period of time is keeping the participants involved. One of way that investigators may be able to improve participant involvement in research is to give participants the opportunity to complete their questionnaires online.

Here's how the investigators think the Internet data collection system will help to keep participants involved and ultimately help to answer important questions about the effects of nutrition during pregnancy:

1. It will allow investigators to present complicated questionnaires in a way that doesn't confuse participants. For example, instead of telling participants to skip the remainder of a question if they answered no to the first part of the question, the ePRO system does the skipping for them. The result is less confusion, fewer questions to read, and less of the participant's time.
2. It provides a convenient way for participants to keep track of where to find the questionnaire, and how much they have already completed. Participants sometimes don't have time to answer all of the investigator's questions in one sitting. The ePRO system keeps track of how much participants have already done and it's ready to keep going whenever the participant has time. It also avoids the common problem of losing the questionnaires to the household paperwork pile, or worse to the recycling bin.
3. It provides timely reminders to participants. Study participants, and especially new moms, are busy and they forget to complete the questionnaires. The ePRO system can provide timely reminders encouraging participants to respond.
4. It helps participants complete the questionnaires accurately. The ePRO system has an automatic error detection ability that will alert participants to any questions they missed or completed incorrectly.

Finding ways to keep participants involved in research is something that all researchers are concerned about, and ultimately it's a concern for all Canadians because the results of research are often used to make decisions about health care and the kinds of programs that governments provide. Losing any participant from the study reduces the ability of policy makers to take the best decisions and choices about what health services to fund with limited dollars. What the investigators propose is a study to determine whether Internet data entry really will keep participants involved in a longitudinal study. Previous studies have shown that the internet can be a useful tool for getting people to sign up for research and at least one small study showed that using Internet data entry can actually save money. But no researchers have actually tested whether it really does a better job than paper based questionnaires in terms of keeping participants involved.

In order to answer this question, the investigators will randomly assign the current Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition study participants to either continue receiving the paper-based questionnaire or to start receiving the web-based surveys. The investigators will follow participants over three assessment occasions (over a period of 18 months) and observe any differences between the groups in their involvement. Because the investigators are randomly assigning participants to the two groups, differences in involvement will tell them about usefulness of Internet data entry as a participant retention tool.",301,FEMALE,16 Years,N/A

A GC/CT-negative control group (n=50) will also be enrolled to compare biological outcomes including changes in levels of inflammatory cytokines following rectal STI. The intervention is based on three interrelated objectives: 1) To use periodic rectal STI nucleic acid testing to identify the members of the MSM population at greatest short-term risk for HIV infection; 2) To provide single-dose antibiotic treatment to control the immune activation and mucosal inflammation caused by rectal GC/CT infection that increase cellular risk for HIV transmission; and 3) To use Personal Cognitive Counseling (PCC) to understand and modify recent high-risk sexual practices that led to rectal STI acquisition and that increase future HIV risk.

The investigators propose to screen 750 behaviorally high-risk MSM for rectal GC/CT infection to enroll 100 GC/CT-positive individuals (using a conservative 15% prevalence estimate) and 50 GC/CT-negative controls (matched by age and baseline frequency of URAI).

When a pregnancy is complicated by a diagnosis of AL, clinicians face a complex dilemma: to balance risking the mother's survival through delaying treatment, against the potential harm to the foetus through exposure to cancer drugs. Reports suggest that, providing the first trimester is avoided, successful treatment of AL during pregnancy is possible, and considered safe.

This observational study aims to monitor and record the current treatment and outcomes of patients diagnosed with acute leukaemia during or prior to pregnancy.

The advantage of ACB is its dominant sensory nerve block effect. It preserves quadriceps muscle strength compared with the FNB. This will serve as potential gain for early rehabilitation and thereby functional outcome. Adequate direct injection of local anesthetic into the canal will block four nerves: the saphenous nerve, the nerve to the vastus medialis, the medial femoral cutaneous nerve, and the terminal end of the posterior division of the obturator nerve. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is often associated with postoperative severe pain. Postoperative early rehabilitation is the primary focus to restore pre-injury status and is an essential part of the full recovery, especially that this rehabilitation extents over a 6 month period. Early elimination of pain is necessary to achieve this goal. However, there are no clear conclusive clinical reports defining the adequate analgesic volume-dosage of local anesthetic for ACB for postoperative ACL pain management. The investigators speculated that volume-dosage manipulation play key role in the effective of ACB for postoperative pain. The investigators conducted this prospective, randomized, observer-blinded trial to compare 3 combinations of volume and dosage of 0.25 % bupivacaine for US-guided ACB.

A poor posture can increase the number of punctures, patient discomfort, and risk of complications. An adequate position reverses lumbar lordosis, facilitating the access to the intervertebral space. In most cases, insertion of the epidural analgesia catheter is performed in sitting position or in lateral decubitus, the choice being generally guided by the preference of the anesthetist.

According to anesthetists' experience in the obstetrical anesthesia unit at Necker-Enfants Malades hospital, a cross-legged sitting position is comfortable for parturients, restricts interfering movements during the procedure, and provides adequate widening of interspinous spaces. This position results in knees and hips flexion, tilting the pelvis backward and opening the interspinous spaces, while limiting muscular strain to maintain the position. However, literature on this matter is scarce.

NCT01028482,['Postpartum Depression'],2008-03,2010-11,"Introduction:

Postpartum depression (PPD) occurs in large numbers of women (between 10 - 20%) and substantially affects both their own well-being and their offspring's mental and emotional development. Whereas PPD is a form of major depression, its etiology is probably related to a combination of biological (hereditary, hormonal etc.), and psychological factors. In practice, most women suffering from PPD do not seek treatment, or are treated with psychotherapy alone due to concerns regarding pharmacotherapy. This is despite the obvious importance of reaching a rapid remission in these women. In fact, data regarding the treatment of PPD with antidepressants is surprisingly sparse and is limited to only one blinded and placebo-controlled study (with fluoxetine) and a number of studies without a placebo arm . The reason for the paucity of double-blinded placebo-controlled studies is probably due to 3 main limiting factors: Firstly, the reluctance of women to ""admit"" to and seek professional help due to depression, Secondly, the difficulty to administer antidepressant medication to lactating women, and, Thirdly, the ethical difficulties in designing a study with a real placebo group.

In contrast to the very limited number of drug studies in this population, there are a number of studies that have shown the efficacy of psychotherapy in the treatment of PPD. Positive studies have been published using different types of psychotherapy, including cognitive, dynamic and interpersonal psychotherapy.

The investigators propose to study the efficacy of psychotherapeutic treatment in women suffering from PPD with add-on sertraline in a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled design. To overcome the difficulties described above in studying antidepressants in the postpartum period, the investigators propose to include active brief dynamic psychotherapy for all women. Furthermore, the investigators will selectively allow inclusion of women who only suffer from either mild or moderate major PPD (not severe / suicidal) .

Hypothesis:

The investigators hypothesize that women with PPD randomized to the arm receiving psychotherapy + active sertraline will show a greater response rate than the psychotherapy + placebo group. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that the difference in response between the 2 groups will demonstrate a significant early response in the active sertraline group.",42,FEMALE,18 Years,45 Years

Low-grade disease is commonly noted by clinicians to be clinically insignificant cancer but remains a psychological burden to many men in this cohort. There is consensus that regular review is required for men on AS so that early treatment can be undertaken if there is disease progression, and to support men living with a cancer diagnosis. Some AS protocols, including National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), advocate the use of MRI as a regular part of the monitoring pathway.

Unfortunately, access to MRI for AS, within the current health care environment in the UK, is limited due to increasing demand for primary diagnostic examinations, particularly in the post pandemic recovery phase. Emerging technologies in ultrasound imaging may, however, add another diagnostic tool to monitor disease for patients on AS. This proof of concept study is to evaluate whether new multi-parametric ultrasound techniques can safely reduce the number of MRIs required for effective AS.

Men being investigated for PCa will be invited to undergo an ultrasound examination of their prostate, via the rectum, in addition to the diagnostic MRI undertaken as part of normal care. The findings of the ultrasound will be directly compared with the MRI and any subsequent biopsy samples taken as part of routine care.

This deficit, or excess, of iron prejudices the mother-child wellbeing. Therefore the hypotheses are that an iron supplementation adapted to values of hemoglobin at the start of the pregnancy will would be more effective in preventing iron deficiency, without increasing the risk of hemoconcentration by the end of pregnancy. This would be helped optimize mother-child health status.

The aims of the study are to determine the highest level of effectiveness of iron supplementation adapted to hemoglobin (Hb) levels in early pregnancy, which would be optimum for mother-child health.

To accomplish this objective a Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) triple-blinded was designed. The study is structured as a RCT with 2 strata, depending on the Hb levels before week 12 of gestation.

Stratum 1: If Hb from 110 to 130 g/L, randomly assigned at week 12 to receive iron supplement of 40 or 80 mg/d.

Stratum 2: If Hb \>130 g/L, randomly assigned at week 12 to receive iron supplement of 40 or 20 mg/d.

This study will be conducted in non-anemic pregnant women at early gestation stage, and their subsequent newborns. The data recollected to mothers will be: socio-economic data, clinical history, food item frequency, lifestyle and emotional state, and adherence to iron supplement prescription. In addition, biochemical measured will be Hemoglobin, serum ferritin, C reactive protein, cortisol, and alterations in the HFE gene (C282Y, H63D). In children, the data collected will be: ultrasound fetal biometry, anthropometric measurements, and temperament development

NCT01613131,['Menopausal and Other Perimenopausal Disorders'],2012-04,2014-06,"Hormonal treatment of perimenopausal women has frequently utilized oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). Because of their ability to suppress ovulation and establish cycle control, OCPs have become a popular option, and one that is FDA approved for use until menopause. However, use of OCPs in women in their 40's and 50's carries significant cardiovascular risks. Venous thromboembolism risk is 3-6 fold greater in OCP users, and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) is approximately doubled in OCP users over the age of 40. This occurs at an age where the background population risk of MI begins to increase, such that the absolute number of cases rises substantially. Women with additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease have a much greater risk for MI (6-40-fold) in association with OCPs. There are also large subgroups of midlife women who are not candidates for OCP use, such a smokers and migraineurs. Moreover, the trend towards lower estrogen dosing with OCPs containing 20 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol has not led to a detectable decrease in thromboembolic risk.

Because of their increased potential risks, it is appropriate to seek alternatives to OCPs and to explore lower doses of hormones to relieve perimenopausal symptoms that occur prior to a woman's final menses. Recent evidence indicates that the hypothalamic-pituitary axis of reproductively aging women is more susceptible to suppression by sex steroids that previously believed. It is possible that hormone doses as low as 50 micrograms of transdermal estradiol (TDE) can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary axis of midlife women. It is also tempting to speculate that the low but measurable circulating doses of levonorgestrel that are present when a woman uses the Mirena intrauterine system (IUS) can contribute to or even independently suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, and reduce the hormonal fluctuations that result in worsening of perimenopausal symptoms. The combination of low dose TDE plus Mirena may therefore confer superior symptom control as well as contraceptive effectiveness, at far less risk.",39,FEMALE,40 Years,52 Years

However, leg fat may not simply be benign with respect to disease risk, but may in fact protect against cardiovascular disease risk. Although the mechanism for this is unknown, the investigators hypothesize that removing a portion of this important fat depot (via liposuction) could increase disease risk. Such unfavorable results may or may not be transient depending on an individual's ability to defend their fat mass. Because sex hormones appear to play a role in regional fat accumulation, the investigators hypothesize that estrogen-deficient postmenopausal women may have an augmented abdominal fat accumulation and an attenuated hip and thigh re-accumulation compared to premenopausal women following lipectomy and compared to non-surgical controls. As a result, the increased abdominal fat accumulation may worsen disease risk in postmenopausal women. Menopause-related differences in fat storage at baseline are also expected to determine the degree to which lipectomy alters disease risk and the propensity for AT re-accumulation.",53,FEMALE,35 Years,60 Years

To counteract the prevalence of WRMSD, human-robot interaction could improve the power of a person and reduce the physical strain. For the lower back, a reduction of spinal loading could be helpful. The passive upper-extremity exoskeleton Laevo® is developed to support physically heavy work: it supports the back during bending and should, consequently, result in less low back pain (Laevo®, the Netherlands).

OBJECTIVES The primary aim of this study is to assess to what extent wearing the exoskeleton changes:

* muscular activity of the erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles;
* knee compression force;
* posture of the upper and lower spine, trunk, hips and knees; ...in different tasks (static vs. dynamic), different trunk postures (trunk flexion vs. trunk flexion and rotation) and different knee postures (straight vs. stooped).

Secondary aims of this study are to assess to what extent wearing the exoskeleton changes:

* muscular activity of the trapezius descendens, rectus abdominis, vastus medialis and gastrocnemius medialis;
* perceived discomfort;
* heart rate;
* internal loadings on the spine, using a lumbar spine model;
* the performance of subjects during functional activities (e.g., stair climbing) when wearing the exoskeleton (either turned on or off); ...in different tasks (static vs. dynamic), different trunk postures (trunk flexion vs. trunk flexion and rotation), different knee postures (stoop vs. squat), and different static holding positions(0° vs. 30° vs. 60°) with different weights (0kg vs. 8kg vs. 16kg).",39,MALE,18 Years,40 Years

NCT04456920,"['Breast Cancer', 'Biopsy Wound']",2021-02-09,2023-11-20,"Each year, approximately 1500 breast biopsies (1000 microbiopsies and 500 macrobiopsies) are performed in the radiologic department of the Montpellier Cancer Institute (ICM). This exam, which is relatively easy for the radiologist, can however lead to major anxiety for patients. Indeed, previous studies show that about 50% of women undergoing a breast biopsy have significant anxiety affects.

Anxiety associated with the risks of biopsy, potential breast cancer diagnosis and/or lack of routine sedation procedures increase patient concerns. Distress prior to biopsy is associated with greater pain and discomfort during the procedure. The psychological distress that persists after the biopsy is related to a worse psychological management of side effects of the biopsy breast (e.g., sensitivity, skin irritation).

Limiting apprehension, worry and anxiety induced by the uncertainty linked to the biopsy results and the biopsy-related pain should be an integral part of the medical care through the patient follow-up during, after and until the diagnosis is announced. In light of these challenges, new alternative methods are emerging to enhance patient knowledge, develop procedural skills, improve confidence and mitigate procedural anxiety. However, to our knowledge, few methods have been developed during this period of 'waiting-time'. Currently, only care instructions and a consultation to announce the results (about 10 days after the procedure) are proposed to patients at the end of biopsy. Patients are also encouraged to call if they suspect complications such as infection or bleeding.

In this context, the investigators propose to integrate a pain management after biopsy via e-health system through the patient's medical care. Radiologist/patient communication could have an impact on patients' anxiety and health-related issues, given the challenging nature of discussions around need for breast biopsy and potential implications of the results. Indeed, paying attention and focusing on symptoms as patients experience them improves their empowerment and their adjustment to the disease.

Web-based systems that can provide electronic-Patient reported Outcomes (e-PRO) have been shown to prompt clinicians to intensify symptom management, to improve symptom control and to enhance patient-clinician communication patient satisfaction, as well as well-being. In addition, it is known that improved communication between patients and medical staff to less anxiety after a biopsy and that anxiety is related to pain.

Taken as a whole, these elements encourage the integration of e-health and e-PRO for the management of pain and anxiety in patients undergoing a biopsy. The benefits of e-PRO are still being discussed in terms of quality of life (Qol) and psychological distress. The investigator propose to integrate two types of e-health intervention: 1/e-PRO collected by connected objects (smartphone or tablet) as they were used in previous studies, and 2/ e-PRO collected by a phone consultation, which values human communication between the medical staff and the patient.

In case of significant pain, the collection of e-PRO by any of these e-health interventions will generate an alert and a reactive and responsive care.

In fine, the purpose of this research is to improve the medical organization and care of post-biopsy patients by proposing an innovative connected patient technology, regardless of their remoteness from the hospital.

Prostate cancer that grows despite castrate levels of testosterone and that no longer responds to any form of hormonal manipulation is defined as castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

Docetaxel combined with prednisolone has been shown to not only improve QOL and PSA response in CRPC, but also extend the overall survival1. However, the efficacy of the drug has not been universally effective, and nearly all patients have disease progression after docetaxel treatment.

After failure of a docetaxel regimen, With the exception of cabazitaxel or abiraterone, which are not widely and easily availabe in Korea, little treatment regimen can be applied to the patients with reasonable response and benefits.

Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog with activity against a broad spectrum of solid tumors. When gemcitabine is used as first-line therapy for CRPC, disease control rate was 33% with median duration of 7.1 months. When it is combined with prednisone and zoledronic acid in pretreated patients with CRPC, the PSA response rate was 23% with a disease control rate of 57% in patients with measurable disease.

Oxaliplatin is newer platinum agent that has favorable toxicity profile and evidence of activity in cisplatin-resistant cell lines. Droz et al. performed a multicenter phase II study in 54 patients with metastatic CRPC who were randomized to receive oxaliplatin either alone or with 5-FU.

Healthcare services have improved how they manage self-harm in the community and prisons. However, there has been little focus on the recovery of people with self-harm scars. Medical skin camouflage (MSC) is a British National Formulary-listed topical cream designed to cover skin conditions. Research on MSC has focused on its use with non-self-harm marks e.g. burns. The evidence from this research suggests that the cream helps women feel better and do more activities. There is little/no evidence about the effects of the preparation for women who self-harm and for prisoners.

This research was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Research for Patient Benefit Programme. In the research the investigators will examine whether it is possible and practical to use MSC in prison. The investigators will ask women prisoners and staff what they think about the cream. The research has four parts. In the first part the investigators will run focus groups with women prisoners and prison staff to find out the best way to deliver the MSC intervention and how to measure its effects. In the second part the investigators will design a programme for delivering the MSC. The investigators will then train 6-10 long-term prisoners to become skin camouflage practitioners.

NCT00539474,['Breast Cancer'],2008-01,2010-06,"Rationale:

Approximately 25% of breast cancers detected are non palpable. Accordingly, a localization technique is required to help the surgeon to find and remove the cancer. The current technique (wire guided localization \[WGL\]) is difficult to perform and has a high rate of tumour positive margins in the resected specimen, requiring a second operation. A new approach in the localization and resection of non-palpable malignant breast lesions is 'radio guided occult lesion localization' (ROLL). ROLL was introduced as a possible replacement for WGL at the 'European Institute of Oncology' in Milan in 1996. This technique utilizes the intratumourally injected radiotracer, that is generally used for the lymphatic mapping and SNB, to localize the primary tumour guided by the gamma probe. Five studies so far have proven the applicability of this method.

Objective:

To evaluate the efficacy of Radio Occult Lesion Localisation (ROLL) versus Wire guided Localisation (WGL) in breast conserving surgery for non-palpable breast cancer

Study design:

A multicenter, prospective randomized clinical trial. Patients with proven non-palpable breast cancer will be randomized for either ROLL or WGL.

Study population:

316 women with a core biopsy proven non palpable cT1 breast carcinoma that are eligible for a breast conserving treatment and sentinel node biopsy (SNB).

Intervention (if applicable):

Patients in the WGL group will undergo intra tumoural injection of a nuclear radiotracer under stereotactic or ultrasonographic guidance. After scintigraphic imaging, to monitor the migration of the radiotracer, a guide wire will be inserted under stereotactic or ultrasonographic guidance. The excision of the primary tumour is guided by the inserted wire and the sentinel node procedure is performed using a gamma probe and intratumoural injection of patent blue.

Patients in the ROLL group will undergo the same procedure except for the guide wire insertion. The excision of the primary tumour is guided by the gamma probe.

Main study parameters/endpoints:

Primary study endpoints; ROLL vs WGL:

1. The percentage of tumour-free margins (invasive and in situ)
2. The volume and maximum diameter of the lumpectomy

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness:

There is no pre-, per- or post operative extra burden. The radiofarmacon is already used in the standard care of breast cancer patients for the sentinel node biopsy. The used radio-active substance does not damage the patient.

A specific burden questionnaire, aimed at evaluating the burden of the cosmetic result, will be administered. To further assess the net impact in terms of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) also the EQ5D will be obtained at T = 0, 6, 12 and 26 weeks after the initial diagnostic work-up.

Should the results indicate that overall the WGL procedure lead to better clinical outcome a cost-effectiveness analysis is foreseen using bootstrapping to assess the uncertainty with regard to the balance between costs and effects. All analyses will be limited to a half year time horizon. Accordingly, discounting of costs or effects is not applicable.",316,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A

NCT04382274,['Hysterectomy'],2020-05-02,2020-10-31,"Multimodal pain management program is needed to control severe pain after abdominal hysterectomy which is considered as one of the major abdominal surgeries. Opioids (which are the analgesic of choice) have many adverse effects such as sedation, nausea, and vomiting. Hence, different methods are needed to control pain and decrease opioid consumption and its side effects.

Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block blocks the sensory afferent nerves run between the abdominal muscles and controls postoperative incisional pain.

Blanco was the first who described the quadratus lumborum block (QLB). Somatic pain after upper and lower abdominal surgery can be controlled by QLB. QLB can be performed for all generations (adult, pediatrics, and pregnant).

QLB is considered to be an easy technique to learn as it is easy to get the key sonoanatomic markers for QLB. The novice can learn this block after only a few performance of the procedure. QLB produces effective postoperative analgesia after abdominal surgery, laparoscopic surgery, anterior abdominal wall surgery, and hip and femur surgery. The analgesic effect of QLB covers 24-48 h. While some authors inserted catheter for continuous infusion of the local anesthetic drug to extend the duration of postoperative analgesia, others added dexamethasone to local anesthetic to extend the effect of local anesthetic drugs.

Ultrasound (US)-guided Ilioinguinal and Iliohypogastric nerve and TAP block have been established as analgesic adjuncts for post hernia repair pain management, under general anaesthesia, neuraxial, MAC and infiltration techniques.

US-guided technique of blocking Ilioinguinal and Iliohypogastric nerves have higher success rate compared to conventional technique.

Disparities in early language environments contribute to the gap in school readiness between poor and more advantaged children. Ultimately this leads to disparities in students' school achievement and economic outcomes. While recent research has highlighted the value of early intervention for children in disadvantaged families, most existing interventions begin too late, reach only a small proportion of children at risk, and do not capitalize on the critical role that parent language plays in a child's educational trajectory. To address this challenge, the investigators propose to develop and evaluate a novel language-based, perinatal public health intervention, Thirty Million Words Newborn Initiative (TMW-NI). It is proposed that new mothers will receive this educational intervention while their babies are undergoing the universal newborn hearing screen. The intervention will use video, animation, and interactive questions to convey the importance of the early language environment and to illustrate strategies parents can use to promote language learning.

Simultaneous assessment of gastric motility by means of an isovolumetric balloon and dynamic cine-MRI can validate that slow, high-amplitude intraballoon pressure waves are indeed induced by gastric muscle contractions.

It is associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal (death, eclampsia, abruptio placenta, HELLP syndrome) and perinatal (perinatal death, growth restriction, prematurity) outcomes. The only definite treatment of PE remains pregnancy termination. Therefore, prevention of PE remains an important challenge. Low dose aspirin may be used in the prevention of PE, particularly in women who had a severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks. Its efficiency, however, is very weak. Recently, it has been suggested that low molecular weight heparin might be useful in the prevention of PE.

A pro-drug of abiraterone, abiraterone acetate (Zytiga®), was developed to overcome its poor bio-availability and is fully converted to the active moiety abiraterone. Abiraterone acetate tablets are administered at a fixed oral dose of 1000mg QD in a fasted state in combination with 10mg prednisolon daily.

Abiraterone acetate has a low solubility in aqueous media and a low permeability. The bioavailability of abiraterone acetate is significantly influenced when ingested with food. Ingesting abiraterone acetate with a low fat or a high fat meal resulted respectively in a 5- or 10-fold increase in AUC0-∞. The high and low fat FDA meals used in these food effect studies differ largely from breakfasts taken in everyday life (ca. 800-1000 cal). A continental breakfast contains 160 to 320 calories of which 25-50% is fat, is more compatible with a normal lifestyle and therefore easily sustainable in daily practice. However, the effect of a continental breakfast on the absorption of abiraterone is unknown yet. Furthermore, increasing healthcare costs are a growing concern in all developed countries. Therefore effort should be invested to keep anticancer treatment affordable. A food intervention resulting in a better absorption and enhanced exposure to abiraterone, can lead to a reduced dose, which could significantly impact health care costs for a tumor which is as prevalent as metastatic prostate cancer.

The investigators hypothesized that INTV and INTM training were equally effective in improving Wmax, Lactate threshold and onset of blood lactate accumulation, but INTV was superior in enhancing performance in mountai bike race simulation.This hypothesis is due to studies that have shown higher gains in performance with long duration of aerobic high intensity interval training in comparison to the shorter training at a higher intensity.",16,MALE,20 Years,50 Years

Poor accrual to trials has major implications with regards to the pace of progress, the cost of clinical cancer research, and the generalizability of results. The investigators have recently shown in an analysis of 7,776 cancer clinical trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov that approximately 20% of cancer clinical trials fail to complete enrollment at all; the most often cited reason was poor accrual.

Prior research has identified barriers to cancer clinical trial accrual that can be generally categorized in the domains of availability, awareness, and acceptance. Much attention has been paid to the barriers involvement awareness and acceptance - however, trial availability is likely a ""rate limiting step"".

NCT00434265,['Obesity'],2007-03,N/A,"Obesity is the consequence of a chronic disequilibrium of fat balance. Genetic factors determine predisposition to obesity, but the most often mentioned idea is that environmental factors, such as a high-fat diet and a sedentary lifestyle, join to favour weight gain and explain the increased prevalence of obesity in our westernized societies. Since lipogenesis is negligible in humans, obesity represents the consequence of altered fat partitioning between oxidation and storage, likely due to a preferential directing of dietary fat towards adipose tissue and away from muscle. Interventions that favour partitioning of dietary fat towards muscle for oxidation might thus protect against weight gain. Exercise may be one kind of such intervention but the scant data on dietary fat metabolism does not allow clear conclusions, in particular in obese subjects. One question concerns the impact of the type of fat eaten: the effects of physical inactivity may vary according to the length and saturation degree of the fatty acids. We hypothesize that 1) physical activity of moderate intensity, independently of its effect on energy balance, will favor a preferential trafficking towards adipose tissue, will modify the expression of genes implicated in fat oxidation and storage and partly correct the abnormalities observed in obese subjects, 2) effects of physical activity vary according to the saturation degree of fat.

Is the subjective assessment of the quality of obstetrical ultrasonography pictures by a young practitioner and an experienced one can be similar to that of an objective tool, such as the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)? The contrast-to-noise ratio is commonly used in radiology to evaluate image quality by assessing the ability to distinguish differences between two elements.

The investigators selected a retrospective cohort of 198 patients, including three pictures per fetus screened between 18 and 18 weeks and 6 days.

As well as, the inability to maintain optimum performance and generate maximum voluntary contractions during a physical exercise. When performing physical activity, the body's metabolic response increases proportionally to exercise to satisfy the demands of the human physiological. Part of the energy accumulated during exercise is lost to the environment in the form of heat and another part is maintained internally through the physiological control for thermoregulation. In addition, the muscle generates an electric signal important to determine its status regarding power and fatigue.

NCT04823065,"['Endometrial Cancer', 'Ovarian Cancer']",2018-09-01,2023-08-31,"This project is about exploring a novel method to detect ovarian and uterine cancers earlier and better. More precisely, a high-performance radioactive estrogen analog will be used to visualize hormone-sensitive uterine and ovarian tumors using PET imaging. Not only this imaging methodology could improve the whole-body assessment of those diseases, but will also hint clinicians about the optimal course of therapy to undertake.

The lead investigator's team designed in the past years an innovative radioactive estrogen derivative tracer (4FMFES) for the medical imaging modality termed Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The compound was first shown to be safe for human use. Recently, a clinical trial demonstrated that 4FMFES-PET is superior to any existing comparable tracer for detection of hormone-sensitive breast cancer patients. 4FMFES is particularly useful to pinpoint unsuspected metastases early, which allowed better breast cancer patient management and staging. 4FMFES and standard FDG PET imaging were shown to be complementary in breast cancer, the use of both techniques together providing a detection rate nearing 100%. Since ovarian and uterine cancers are about as likely to be targeted by 4FMFES as breast cancer, the use of this novel precision imaging method will be adapted to those other indications.

In general, the sooner a cancer is diagnosed and treated, the better the outcome of a patient will be. Gynecological cancers lack precise screening and detection tools. In particular, while a majority of uterine cancers are relatively well managed, patients burdened with metastatic burden have a much worse prognosis, and precise and early detection of those lesions will greatly help clinicians to better treat those complicated cases. As for ovarian cancers, they are usually devoid of clinical symptoms until late onset, which partly explain the high mortality rate of this disease. Hence, for both diseases, a precision, whole-body imaging technique will allow earlier assessment, followed by earlier intervention, resulting in improved survival rate and better quality of life for patients.",53,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A

NCT02863874,"['Skin Structures and Soft Tissue Infections', 'Wound Infection']",2016-01,2018-02,"INTRODUCTION It is estimated that over 80% of women who give vaginal birth will sustain some form of perineal tear and of these 60-70% will require suturing. It is of great importance that operators are familiar with the best suturing technique and suture material in order to minimize possible associated short- and long-term sequelae. There is evidence for suturing continuously to reduce postoperative pain and superficial dyspareunia, but the choice of suture-material is still debated. The function of a suture is to close the wound to minimize the bleeding, the risk for infection and to adapt the wound edges to promote anatomic correct healing. Infection results in softened wound edges, shirked sutures, pain and dehiscence. Delayed and/or compromised wound healing is correlated with impaired strength in the affected tissue. Reported frequency of infection after first and second degree tear is between 1 and 11% where the discrepancy most likely is due to poor registration and follow-up. In 2004 Polyglactin 910 was launched with a new antibacterial coating of Triclosan (VicrylPlus®). Studies suggest a correlation between the use of VicrylPlus® and a reduction of up to 30% of surgical site infections (SSI) compared to conventional sutures in a non-colonized wound.

OBJEKTIVE: The primary objective is to compare infection rates and pain intensity when using Vicryl® versus VicrylPlus® for perineal repair after delivery. Secondly, to show if there is a difference in sequelae (pelvic floor dysfunction) after one year between the two groups.

METHODS The participants are randomly allocated to continuously suturing with either Vicryl® or VicrylPlus®. Sealed identical-looking envelopes are prepared and placed in the delivery room (randomized into blocks of 50) containing randomization number, sutures, declaration of informed consent and questionnaires. The participants are instructed to fill in the first questionnaire after 7 days and the second questionnaire after 8 weeks post partum. After 8 weeks all participants are offered a routine visit to the ""out-patient clinic"". After one year an internet-based survey will be sent out to the participants.

CSE is not only beneficial for its faster onset of analgesia, but also it is favorable in relation to the need for rescue analgesia, urinary retention, and rate of instrumental delivery compared to the traditional epidural. Despite its beneficial effects, there is a risk of about 15-30% of developing abnormal fetal heart rate following CSE. This is self-resolving with minimal or no intervention. Although the cause of fetal bradycardia is not fully elucidated, variations in uterine artery blood flow after epidural analgesia are thought to be due to the interaction of numerous events related to blockade of sympathetic innervations, fluid administration, maternal hypotension, uterine vascular effects of sympathetic block, fluctuations in circulating catecholamines, and possibly the effect of opioids. Similar mechanism is thought to be a cause of fetal bradycardia after the CSE with its faster onset and superior block.

Maternal or fetal circulation during labor can be assessed using continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound to monitor maternal uterine artery (UtA) and fetal umbilical artery (UmA) velocity waveforms to detect changes in blood flow. The velocimetry indices mentioned above have been often used to assess the changes in the blood flow before and after the induction of epidural analgesia during labor in several studies. Although there are some studies regarding the effect of labor epidural analgesia using velocimetry indices, but there is currently no published study evaluating velocimetry indices of uterine and umbilical arteries before and after the induction of CSE. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the impact of CSE to maternal and fetal blood flow to evaluate the relationships.

The investigators hypothesize that both uterine artery and umbilical artery blood flow are reduced after the induction of CSE, which may be responsible for the occurrence of fetal bradycardia.",30,FEMALE,18 Years,50 Years

NCT00915031,['Prostate Cancer'],2009-08,2015-06,"Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RLP) has gained widespread acceptance as a standard treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer. Despite the enhanced visualization and precise dissection afforded by the robotic platform, two major comorbidities affect a significant number of men: incontinence and erectile function.

Urinary continence and erectile function

It is commonly believed that the most important factor affecting continence is preservation of the external urinary sphincter complex which lies just below the prostate. Trauma to the urethral tissue itself after it is transected from the prostate and damage to the autonomic nerves that control this sphincter may lead to sphincteric dysfunction. In addition, dissection of the bladder may lead to bladder irritability which also plays a role in incontinence. Surgical removal of the prostate also causes significant inflammatory damage to the pelvic floor which likely delays recovery of urinary continence. The same trauma issues apply to sexual function.

One possible method to protect the nerves and other tissues from operative trauma may be the use of local hypothermia (cold-ischemia) to the pelvis. Local tissue hypothermia using ice, ice slush, or cold irrigation has been safely and routinely used for decades in humans during brain, heart, and kidney surgery to minimize organ damage. Yet, this technique has never been applied to prostate surgery. We will accomplish local cooling of the pelvis using a cooling balloon inserted into the rectum.

Currently available treatments are unfortunately for now not fully efficient, therefore researchers have recommended to develop prevention initiatives. Until now, no study has been carried out in Switzerland to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention for the prevention of eating disorders.

The goal of the present study is to evaluate two eating disorders prevention intervention that have been largely validated in the US, called the Body Project (BP) and the Healthy Weight Program (HW). Both interventions target body dissatisfaction, which is a well-identified risk factor of eating disorders. They will be compared to a one-month waiting list. Because of the pandemic situation due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (COVID-19), both interventions will be delivered virtually via a collaborative platform. The sessions will be recorded to carry out a quality control.

To compare the BP and HW interventions to a waiting list, a three-arm randomized controlled study will be carried out, including female students from French-speaking Switzerland. Recruitment will include 90 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three arms of the study. They will be evaluated before (T0) and after (T1) the interventions or the waiting list. Following the interventions, the participants will have one month of follow-up before a final evaluation (T2). Participants on the waiting list will receive the BP following the one-month waiting period and will then be evaluated (T2).

Randomization will be blocked to ensure groups of equal size, and that groups of six participants for each arm are regularly formed. The blocks will be of variable size (3, 6, 9) to protect the concealment.

However, the incidence of hypotension after spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery is high and can lead to maternal and fetal morbidities. Certain interventions may reduce the incidence and severity of spinal anesthesia induced hypotension, including the use of vasopressors and intravenous pre- or co-hydration using different types of volume expanders; crystalloid or colloid solutions. Such interventions aim to increase maternal cardiac output, which is the key in attenuating the hypotensive response to spinal anesthesia.

The primary purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of intravenous prehydration (preloading) of healthy parturients scheduled for caesarean section with either a crystalloid (Ringer's lactated) or colloid solution (HES 130/0.42) in the prevention of hypotension after spinal anesthesia.

The number of students which use neuro enhancement to improve their performance and to prevent test anxiety, is increasing. A US-survey estimated that almost 7% of students in US universities have used prescription stimulants against anxiety, and that on some campuses, up to 25% of students had used them in the past year.

Acupuncture might act as an alternate. Several trials could demonstrate, that different forms of acupuncture could relieve symptoms of pre-exam anxiety syndrome significantly and that this therapy was highly safe. In special, the investigation of single point effects in test anxiety could be of general interest. The acupuncture point with the most convincing evidence up to date is Heart 7. Yet, its effectiveness has mainly been chosen in combination with other acupuncture points and not as single remedy in test anxiety. Therefore we establish a trial investigating the immediate needling effects at Heart 7 on the reduction of test anxiety.

NCT04510831,['Iron-deficiency'],2020-10-26,2020-12-08,"Due to the growing world population, there is a need to develop viable ecological and nutritional alternatives to animal food products. However, animal products are a key dietary source of well-absorbed iron, and iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia remain highly prevalent in high- and low-income countries. Meat and fish provide a substantial proportion of absorbed iron in the western diet by two distinct components: a) heme iron is well absorbed (20-45% fractional absorption) and is not affected by most dietary enhancers and inhibitors, which often affect non-heme iron absorption; b) peptides in muscle meat exert an enhancing effect the absorption of non-heme iron contained in other meal components. The potential of edible insects as a dietary source of well-absorbed iron has not been investigated in detail. In particular, it is unclear whether insects provide an iron moiety similar to hemoglobin which would be well absorbed and unaffected by other dietary components, and whether their presence in a test meal exerts an enhancing effect on iron bioavailability from the whole meal.

Furthermore, chitin, a major component of insect biomass, is a known iron binder and is potentially responsible for a decreased iron absorption from insect-based foods. Decreasing chitin content could allow the high amounts of iron in insects to be well-absorbed, and enhance the absorption of iron from plant-based foods. To differentiate iron absorption from insect biomass from other sources, insects will be intrinsically labelled with the stable iron isotope 57Fe, while other food iron components will be labelled with the iron isotope 58Fe.The present study will provide novel data to elucidate the nutritional value as sources of dietary iron of insect species (Tenebrio molitor).

NCT01215331,['Gestational Diabetes Mellitus'],2010-08,2014-04,"Gestational diabetes mellitus takes place in 2 steps. First, it is the consequence of insulin resistance due to the modifications of the pregnancy hormonal environment, and second, of the deficiency of the beta cells of the pancreas to respond by a sufficient insulin secretion. This physiopathology is closely connected to the one of type 2 diabetes. Insulin, indeed, can remedy these 2 etiologies, but it is logical to think about using oral hypoglycemic agents which have been created to treat them: they are a natural choice because they improve insulin sensitivity (metformin, a biguanide) or insulin secretion (glyburide, a sulfonylurea). It also seems natural to use them in combination, glyburide being added to metformin if needed.

OUR GENERAL RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS IS THAT: in pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus, using both oral hypoglycemic agents (glyburide added to metformin if needed) allows a glycemic control comparable to the one obtained with insulin, but with a better acceptability from women and a better health status, diabetes treatment satisfaction and well-being and a reduced postnatal depression.",73,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A

The investigators' laboratory played a leading role in defining the estimated average requirement (EAR) and the recommended dietary intake for the ""essential"" amino acids (Dietary Reference Intakes 2005). The other important but less well studied component of Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) is - What is a safe upper limit of intake? The investigators now propose to determine the safe upper limits of the dietary essential amino acids. The recently published DRI (2005) defines the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) as 'the highest average daily nutrient intake level that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population.' As intake increases above the UL, the potential risk of adverse effects may increase'.

The investigators will recruit up to 45 Cedars employees (excluding Dr Bairey Merz's employees) with menopausal symptoms by posting a study flyer on Exchange. If a patient is interested in this study, she may contact the research team for further information. Once a patient is identified as being eligible for the study, she will be contacted to schedule the screening visit. They will receive an explanation of the study. They will be sent the consent form to review prior to the initial visit. At the initial visit, prior to any study-related procedures, the consent will be reviewed with the patient. After all questions have been answered and the patient appears to fully understand the study, the patient will be asked to provide written consent.

This pilot project will collect data from three study groups as stated in the NIH application proposal. The first research study group will undergo traditional acupuncture (TA). The second research study group will receive alternative acupuncture (AA). The third group will be a waiting control group (WC) that will receive four weeks of acupuncture following completion of the study duration.

Traditional acupuncture means that the needle is inserted in true acupuncture point locations. Alternative acupuncture is a technique that varies slightly from traditional acupuncture and is used to assess which technique, if any, produces the best therapeutic results. Waiting control is a group of subjects who get neither traditional nor alternative acupuncture during the duration of treatment, which in this case, is 3 months.

Patients will be randomized into one of the three study groups, and will have one in three chance of being placed in one of the three groups. Neither patients nor the investigators can choose which group patients are assigned to. Patients from TA and AA groups will be asked to come to Cedars-Sinai a total of 39 times (36 sessions and 3 clinic visits) over a three-four month period. It will compare the effects (good or bad) of traditional acupuncture (TA) with alternative acupuncture (AA) on the menopausal symptoms to be studied in this research. Patients from WC group will be asked to come to Cedars-Siani a total of 15 times. Other study procedures include physical exam, blood and urine collection for hormone tests, questionnaire interview, etc.

Preterm birth is the leading cause of perinatal death and handicap in children. It is clear that ICSI pregnancies are at high risk groupfor preterm delivery (PTD). In singletons there is an estimated two-fold increased risk following ICSI.

CL measurement with ultrasound in mid-trimester (22-24 weeks) is the best method for the prediction of PTD: The shorter the CL, the higher risk of PTD. Recent evidence suggests that at first trimester (11-13 weeks), the risk for PTD is inversely related to CL. It has been shown that the measurement of CL on pregnancy is an effective method for identification of the group at high risk for PTD.

In embryo transfer, catheter is placed the through cervical canal. The method we will use in this study, CL measurement with transfer catheter, will give more precise results than measurement with ultrasound.

No study has been performed to evaluate the prediction of PTD by analyzing measurements of CL, preconceptionally. Our study will be the first in this topic.

There is a certain disadvantage of measuring CL during pregnancy: The effectiveness of prophylactic administrations (progesterone, cervical cerclage etc.) may be inversely related to the gestation at which treatment is initiated. If we know the risk of PTD before gestation, single embryo transfer will be preferred to avoid from multiple pregnancies that also increase the relative risk of PTD, in ICSI pregnancies.",N/A,FEMALE,N/A,N/A

NCT02935972,['Pain Relief During Prostate Biopsy'],2013-11,2014-11,"Prostate biopsy under transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance is considered the procedure of choice for diagnosing prostate cancer. And as in any other diagnostic biopsy procedures; patients perceive anxiety before, during and after biopsy and ultrasound guided prostate biopsy is not an exclusion.

TRUS guided prostatic biopsies are mainly performed in an outpatient clinic, men undergoing transrectal prostate biopsy experience considerable psychological stress. It may be attributable to the fear of the potential diagnosis of cancer, the anal route of penetration, the fact that the subject organ examined is part of the sexual system and the anticipated pain and as a matter of fact the issues of discomfort and pain perceived throughout the procedure referred to the negative impact of the whole procedure, that is probe insertion and biopsy punctures.

Thus it is essential to employ a simple method that can liberate the patient from pain during prostate biopsy. Some studies recommend sedation , others recommend intra-rectal lidocaine gel and others periprostatic nerve block while others recommend Nitrous oxide inhalation as an effective method of analgesia for the procedural related pain or discomfort of prostate biopsy. The employment of analgesics, sedation and/or narcotic medication may alleviate much of the discomfort associated with transrectal prostate biopsy, such treatment may be associated with additional risks. Furthermore, when systemic medication is administered, patients require conscious sedation monitoring during and after the procedure, which may be inconvenient and relatively expensive in addition to their unsuitability to be performed on outpatient clinic basis. Therefore, a simple form of anesthesia is desirable.

Although a wide variety of anesthetic techniques are available for transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, including rectal administration of lidocaine gel, periprostatic nerve blocks, intravenous propofol, and narcotic intramuscular premedication, these methods may not optimally prevent or relieve pain.",336,MALE,40 Years,95 Years

IC/PBS often coexists with other chronic pain syndromes, such as irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyalgia.

Several treatments exist for IC/PBS; some are not effective, others are time consuming for patients to receive, some can take weeks to months before they become effective, and many have risks associated with them. Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) has demonstrated improvement of symptoms in conditions associated with IC/PBS. LDN is defined as less than 5mg of naltrexone. Some adverse effects have been reported with LDN, the most common are vivid dreams, nightmares, and insomnia.

The investigators hypothesis LDN will have greater than 30% reduction in symptoms as defined by the Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index in patients diagnosed with IC/PBS from baseline when compared to placebo. The 30% reduction in pain is a standard outcome measure in the pain literature. This improvement has been seen in prior studies where LDN was used to treat pain syndromes.

NCT00205504,"['Metabolic Syndrome X', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Obesity', 'Cardiovascular Diseases']",2005-06,2009-06,"Oral contraceptives (OCs) are the most widely used method of reversible birth control. However, the long-term cardiovascular safety of the widely used low-dose OCs (ethinyl-estradiol \< 50 mcg) is still debated. Although cardiovascular events are rare in young women whether they use OCs or not, the risks of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke are increased among users of OCs who have conventional cardiovascular risk factors such as use of tobacco, diabetes or hypercholesterolemia. However, the risk of cardiovascular events in OC users with emerging cardiovascular risk factors (such as obesity and the metabolic syndrome) have not been investigated. Recently, the metabolic syndrome has been linked with the risk of cardiovascular disease. The syndrome is a clustering of risk factors in a single individual, and its underlying cause may be insulin resistance. Whether the metabolic syndrome predicts a higher cardiovascular risk in OC users has not been studied. This is a critical problem because the metabolic syndrome is prevalent in 24% of adults. Until the cardiovascular risks in users of OC are clearly defined, the appropriate use of OC with the least harm would not be possible.

The investigator's long-term goal is to understand the best way to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease in women. The objective of this particular project is to obtain pilot data on the extent to which the metabolic syndrome and obesity affects glucose metabolism and cardiovascular risks in women taking OCs. The researchers hypothesize that women with metabolic syndrome and obese women will have worsened glucose metabolism and elevated cardiovascular risks associated with OC use, when compared to normal weight women without the metabolic syndrome. Results of this study will clarify the risk factors for cardiovascular events in women taking OCs, and will serve as pilot data for a National Institutes of Health (NIH) proposal. Once the cardiovascular risk factors of OC users are understood, clinicians can make better informed decisions about contraceptive choices for their patients.",46,FEMALE,18 Years,40 Years

Previous studies have shown that pregnancy, race and ethnicity can affect the way people metabolize nicotine. The information from this study may help scientists develop ways to help pregnant African-American women quit smoking and not start smoking again after delivery.

African-American women 18-30years of age who are in the second trimester of a healthy pregnancy, who are carrying only one baby and who smoke 10 or more cigarettes a day may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination and urine test. They receive counseling to help them quit smoking. Those who cannot quit smoking within 7 to 10 days after receiving counseling may be invited to join the study.

Participants are admitted to a private room in the Pediatric Clinical Research Center at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C., for 48 hours, during which time they are not permitted to smoke.

NCT05840640,['Alcoholic Hepatitis'],2017-10-01,2021-02-28,"Alcoholic hepatitis is related to very high mortality rate. About 40% of the patients died within first 6 months after the detection of the clinical syndrome. Therefore, it is very essential for proper diagnosis and early treatment . In response to acute or chronic liver damage, bone marrow derived stem cells can spontaneously populate liver and differentiate into hepatic cells. Animal and human studies suggested that injured hepatocyte may be replaced by pluripotent bone marrow cells. However, this hepatocyte repopulation is highly dependent on varieties of liver injury and therapeutic conditions. The studies have suggested Granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) can regenerate hepatocyte by fusing with hematopoietic cells, thereby enhancing the liver histology and survival rate.

G-CSF is a cytokine capable to regulate a number of functions in neutrophils. In three recent studies mobilization of bone marrow stem cells induced by G-CSF was observed in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. In two of these studies there was a survival benefit with the use of G-CSF.

Alcoholism leads to decrease in endogenous antioxidant potential. Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) patients show low endogenous antioxidants. Chronic ethanol consumption cause selective deficiency in the availability of reduced glutathione (GSH) in mitochondria has been reported. This is due to impaired functioning of GSH transporter from cytosol to mitochondrial matrix. The effect on glutathione replenishing potential by N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) can be used to reduce oxidative stress, which also has excellent safety profile. Therefore, NAC can be used for severe alcoholic hepatitis treatment due to its therapeutic potential factor. NAC also inhibit apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. In a study high doses of intravenous N-acetyl cysteine therapy for 14 days conferred neither survival benefits nor early biological improvement in severe acute alcoholic hepatitis patients with adequate nutritional support.However, these results must be viewed with caution, since the study suffered from a lack of power. In a recent study, NAC and corticosteroids combination therapy benefits among patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis in 1 month survival, although the final outcome at 6 month survival was not improved. There are no studies on the use of combination therapy of 4 weeks of NAC plus G-CSF in patient with severe alcoholic hepatitis.

Therefore the investigators plan to study the safety and efficacy of combination therapy of G-CSF and 4 weeks of NAC in the patients with alcoholic hepatitis.",66,MALE,18 Years,75 Years

NCT01888640,['Fibromyalgia'],2013-09-30,2018-04-02,"Pain associated with fibromyalgia interferes with daily function, work, and social activities resulting in a decreased quality of life. People with fibromyalgia also have a significant amount of fatigue and a fear of movement. People with fibromyalgia show enhanced excitability of pain neurons in the central nervous system and reduced pain inhibition. Therefore, one of the main treatments for patients with fibromyalgia must focus on pain relief to allow the person to function more independently both at home and at work. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is used by health professionals to deliver electrical stimulation through the skin for pain control. Basic science studies, from the PI's laboratory show that TENS activates descending pain inhibitory pathways to inhibit excitability of pain neurons. Thus the ideal patient population for the treatment of TENS would be one in which there is enhanced central excitability and reduced inhibition; fibromyalgia is such a condition.

Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that application of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) to patients with fibromyalgia will reduce resting and movement-related pain and reduce central excitability by restoring diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC), and that this decrease in pain and/or central excitability will reduce fatigue and fear of movement, thereby improving function and quality of life",301,FEMALE,18 Years,70 Years

A double balloon and oxytocin induced labor at a tertiary maternal and child health centre in Changsha. Inclusion criteria: 1 age ≥18 years; 2 Singleton; 3 no vaginal infection, fetal membranes intact; 4 according with the indication of induced labor \[5\] ; These included delayed pregnancy, hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, cervical Bishop score \< 6, and negative oxytocin provocation test (Oct) . The exclusion criteria were: 1 abnormal head and pelvis, unable to be delivered vaginally; 2 twins; 3 maternal contraindication of vaginal delivery; 4 severe placental dysfunction, unable to tolerate vaginal delivery; 5 there were contraindications for the use of cervical balloon.

1.2 Methods 1.2.1 Operation Method First of all, pregnant women to introduce the procedure of placing the balloon, ease their fear, tension. Assist the patient to take the stone position, sterilize vulva 3 times, spread aseptic towel, expose cervix with vaginal speculum, sterilize vagina and cervix 3 times with iodine cotton ball, after sterilizing the cervical tube 3 times with iodine-complexed cotton swab, insert the disposable dilatation balloon (Henan Bonding Industry Co., Ltd., Yusheng Medical Supervision Machine No. 20180029, model: Type II 18F) into the cervical tube, until the two sacs into the cervical canal and ensure that the double sacs are through the cervical mouth, sub-turn to the cervical inside and outside sacs slowly injected saline 80 ml each. The end of the balloon catheter was fixed to the inner thigh of the pregnant woman with 3m adhesive tape, without restricting the physical activity of the pregnant woman. The operation process is smooth, the pregnant woman has no discomfort, before and after the operation monitoring fetal heart is normal, instructs the pregnant woman to test the fetal movement, closely observes the pregnant woman labor sign and the fetal intrauterine situation. The balloon is usually inserted between 16:00 and 18:00. The balloon is taken out at 8:00 am the next day, oxytocin (Ringe 500ml + oxytocin 2.5 U) was given intravenously to the patients who were not in Labor 1 hour after rupture of membranes. According to the frequency of uterine contractions, if there is no uterine contractions, increase the rate of dripping 8 drops/min, maximum dose not more than 40 drops, until regular uterine contractions, after every half-hour assessment.

1.2.2 Observation indicators Using the hospital electronic medical record information system to search and review the medical records of these women, the age, number of pregnancies, number of parturients, weight gain during pregnancy, height, weight, pre-and post-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) , indication of induced labor, pregnancy complications, gestational age at the time of balloon induced labor, neonatal weight, cervical Bishop score before and after balloon dilatation, occurrence of acute Chorioamnionitis, fetal distress, NST typing, mode of delivery, etc. .

NCT02051231,['Postpartum Hemorrhage'],2013-12,2014-06,"Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide and is caused most commonly by poor uterine muscle tone after delivery. The first line agent used in the prevention and treatment of PPH is oxytocin, which acts by binding with oxytocin receptors (OTR) found on myometrial cells to cause uterine contraction.

Women who require augmentation of labour with oxytocin because of inadequate labour progression are at increased risk of PPH because they have received intravenous oxytocin which exposes the uterus (and OTR) to doses greater than would normally be found without medical intervention. This exposure results in OTR desensitization and decreased uterine sensitivity to oxytocin which may lead to the use of much higher doses of oxytocin (up to 9x) or other agents for preventing and treating PPH with the potential for causing serious drug-related morbidity or fatality to the mother.

Currently, in women who have failed labour augmentation and need to have a Cesarean delivery, it is not known if it would be beneficial to wait a certain period of time after discontinuing intravenous oxytocin before proceeding with the operation. The goal of the waiting time would be to allow the OTRs to recover and resensitize the uterus to the effects of oxytocin to avoid the need for high doses or additional uterus-contracting agents.

Our hypothesis is that there will be a positive correlation between the magnitude of recovery of the myometrium's response to oxytocin and the time elapsed from the desensitizing oxytocin pretreatment (simulated labour augmentation).",22,FEMALE,18 Years,55 Years

This heart problem is referred to as congenital heart block (the most serious being third degree complete block) and represents damage thought to be caused by these autoantibodies. The heart beats abnormally slowly and almost all children require permanent pacemakers before the age of 20. Importantly, women who have had one child with heart block have a ten-fold higher risk of having another child with the same heart condition. Unfortunately, even close monitoring by special techniques during pregnancy does not reverse complete heart block once it is observed. Thus, treatments aimed at prevention are critical. This study will evaluate for the first time whether hydroxychloroquine, a drug used by many patients with SLE, prevents the development of this heart condition.

NCT01548131,['Fear of Childbirth'],2007-11,2012-02,"Site of research: Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH), Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and University of Helsinki Department of Psychology, in collaboration with Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden

In Finland and in Sweden, fear of childbirth is one of the most common reasons for consultation of obstetrician, and for an elective caesarean section. Approximately 5 to 6% of pregnant women suffer from severe fear of childbirth, which disturbs family-life and working and prevents the preparation to normal childbirth and parenthood. It represents as nightmares, panic attacks, anxiety, and as numerous physical complaints. After giving birth it can be difficult for these women to form an early mother-infant-relationship. Their risk for puerperal depression is also increased.

Finland and Sweden have both a long tradition in research of this field. In Finland, the investigators research group started the first out-patient clinic for fearful pregnant women in HUCH in1996. Different strategies how to treat fear of childbirth have been applied to clinical practise. Studies on the treatment for fear of childbirth are, however, scanty. Some descriptive studies have showed that far more than one half of patients can, after the treatment, prepare to a normal vaginal delivery and caesarean without a medical indication can be avoided. The aim of the treatment should be both to avoid unnecessary caesareans, increase the number of uneventful vaginal deliveries and to help the pregnant couple to prepare to parenthood, as well as to prevent puerperal depression.

In this study, psychotherapeutic group psychoeducation is studied as promising treatment for severe fear of childbirth. To screen fear of childbirth, all women coming to ultrasound screening at the 18 to 20 gestational week in HUCH are asked to fill in a specific questionnaire. Those nulliparous women whose score for fear exceeds 95th percentile are randomized to intervention and to control group.

The intervention group is invited to start a psychotherapeutic group therapy based on cognitive and psychodynamic therapy combined with training in relaxation. Each group consists of six nulliparous women and meets six times during pregnancy 120 minutes at a time. Between the sessions the patients fill in a homework questionnaire. One session focuses on the partner's role and the partners are present then. Three months after delivery, the groups meet once more.

The women in the control group stay in the care of community midwives and general physicians. If needed, they are referred to out-patient clinic in the maternity hospital where their fear is treated according the clinical practice of that hospital, mainly support from obstetrician or midwife.

The women and their partners in both groups are asked, approximately one month after the screening and one month before the due date of delivery, to fill in the questionnaires examining depression, self-esteem, general anxiety, social support, marital satisfaction, personal projects and concerns, and efficacy concerning childbirth and maternity. After childbirth, data about the childbirth will be collected. Three months and two years after childbirth mothers and fathers in both groups receive again a psychosocial questionnaires.

The aim of the study is to help the authorities to organize the treatment for fear of childbirth in their districts by examining the benefits of the treatment also in long-run. The investigators hope the results would lead to production of Current Care guidelines for fear of childbirth.",370,FEMALE,N/A,N/A

These factors predispose patients for serious fractures such as hip fractures with substantial morbidity and mortality. The specific mechanisms involved in this negative impact on bone and postural control have not been fully elucidated. It is well known that Vitamin D plays an important role for bone health as well as muscle function and thus indirectly postural control. Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency has been observed among depressed patients. To our knowledge no study has investigated the involvement of Vitamin D in relation to the increased risk of fractures associated with antidepressants. Therefore, this project will investigate the underlying mechanisms leading to skeletal impairment and musculoskeletal symptoms in patients receiving different types of antidepressants. Moreover, the effect of vitamin D supplementation will be investigated among patients taking these antidepressants.

150 subjects will participate in this study: 50 of which is diagnosed with depression and receive Citalopram (SSRIs); 50 depressed subjects receiving Mirtazapine(NaSRI); and 50 controls. Through randomisation half of the subjects in each group will receive daily Vitamin D supplementation for a period of one year. Through this period all 150 subjects will be followed through different measurements including bone density, muscle function and balance, nociception, quality of life and depression severity.

It is expected that results from this study will provide increasing awareness and knowledge of the side effect profile of antidepressants on bone metabolism. This may prompt clinicians to screen patients at high risk of drug-induced osteopenia or osteoporosis and accordingly provide treatment, which may reduce the incidence of potentially avoidable fractures. Moreover, some types of antidepressants may show to produce a minimal or even no effect on bone turnover, and should be considered as first line treatment in the group of patients at risk of fractures.",71,FEMALE,50 Years,90 Years

However, most studies have evaluated the association between serum progesterone level and clinical outcome in fresh in vitro fertilization /intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles and advocated that serum progesterone elevation on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration may adversely affect the clinical outcome by jeopardizing endometrial receptivity.

In addition, the underlying mechanism through which premature luteinization influences clinical outcomes is elusive. some proposed that premature luteinization cause impairment of the endometrial receptivity, which may indicate a change in the implantation window, is more likely to be affected than the oocyte.whereas some documented that the compromised quality of oocytes might also be a cause.

The cut-off point of premature luteinization is not well established until now. Premature luteinization has been variously defined based on serum P levels, with thresholds of 0.9-1.5 ng/mL being used.

The alteration of the vision requires the surgeon extraction optics in order to achieve a cleaning of the lens. This cleaning is carried out as many times as necessary. Many strategies have been developed to improve the quality of vision. These methods relate to both the development of new optical vision but also the development of the lens cleaning material. In practice, the cleaning is carried out using a sterile swab sterile saline associated with the betadine iodine.

Recently a new material called ""FloShield Air System Vision System"" has been proposed and has the particularity to combine both anti-fog product and a temperature control system in contact with the lens in order to fight against condensation and smoke.

Of the estimated 314,304 women who undergo unsafe abortions each year in Uganda, about 41% receive treatment for complications. This equates to an annual rate of 12 per 1,000 women aged 15-49 years being hospitalized for induced abortion complications, which is considered high in international comparison. In Uganda, outside the larger hospitals and private settings, access to safe post abortion care and surgical facilities are scarce. Studies have showed that trained midwives can deliver safe, effective and acceptable post abortion care using misoprostol in the first trimester. Currently in Uganda, treatment of second trimester incomplete abortion is restricted to physicians. This study will provide evidence on whether treatment for incomplete abortion using misoprostol by mid-level providers can be extended to the early second trimester period. The investigators hypothesize that misoprostol treatment for incomplete second trimester abortion provided by midwives is equivalent to that of physicians requiring no further surgical intervention. Women with incomplete abortion will be randomly allocated to undergo a clinical assessment and treatment with misoprostol either by physician or midwife with safety and effectiveness as main outcomes in the RCT carried out in hospital and high volume health centres in Central Uganda.",1191,FEMALE,15 Years,N/A

NCT01316731,"['Exercise', 'Muscle', 'Gene Expression', 'Myokine']",2011-02,2011-06,"Rationale: Proteins released from muscle during and shortly after exercise, often referred to as myokines, may be central to our understanding of the cross-talk during and after exercise between skeletal muscles and other organs, in particular the liver. So far only a few myokines are identified (e.g. IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, TNF-alpha). Taking into account the role of these several known myokines in developing insulin resistance, revealing new putative myokines might provide valuable information and a direction for future research on the pathogenesis and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Objective: The objective of the present study is to identify novel myokines, expression of which is altered in skeletal muscle after a single bout of exercise.

Study design: experimental study. Study population: Ten healthy, male subjects between 40 and 60 years of age and BMI \< 30 kg/m2, will participate in this study.

Intervention: A single exercise bout that consists of one hour one-legged cycling on a adapted recumbent cycle ergometer at a submaximal rate. The non-exercising leg will serve as control for the exercising leg.

Main study outcomes: Main study outcomes include upregulation of genes in skeletal muscle after exercise (with a focus on genes encoding myokines) and changes of blood plasma levels of selected proteins after exercise.",12,MALE,40 Years,60 Years

Among the maneuvers that are used in the second stage of labor, uterine fundal pressure is one of the most controversial and often diffuse in all over the world, generally not documented, or under reported in medical records . Many Authors affirms that a different new way to push may be of help. This maneuver was introduced by Kristeller, that in 1867 minutely described a procedure to shorten, through the application of a pressure on the uterine fundus whose intensity was quantified by a dynamometer and the duration measured in seconds, the length of the second phase of the labor. Although uterine fundal pressure maneuver was described by Kristeller as the placement of two hands on the uterine fundus and the consequential application of longitudinal steady pressure at a 30- to 45-degree angle directed toward the pelvis, with the avoidance of direct pressure toward the maternal spine, there is no clear definition of the maneuver and no indication for its use has been formally described to date.

These new proteins can increase the size of the fibers within your muscle to make your muscle larger, a process called hypertrophy. The common convention surrounding gains in muscle mass and strength are that higher-loads (i.e. heavier weights) used for fewer repetitions are better for increasing strength and lower-loads (i.e. lighter weights) used for higher repetitions are better for increasing muscle mass. However, recent research has found that when higher- and lower-loads are used when participants exercise until volitional fatigue (i.e. cannot perform another repetition), muscle mass and strength increases are similar regardless of using a higher- or lower-load. Many of these studies have examined this effect in males with fewer studies examining the effects of higher- and lower-load training in females when assessing changes in muscle mass, strength, and muscle endurance.

Further, it has been shown that there is substantial individual variation in response to resistance exercise training where individuals can be broadly categorized as higher- or lower-responders to resistance exercise training.

Placenta accreta spectrum (PAS), formerly known as morbidly adherent placenta, refers to the range of pathologic adherence of the placenta, including placenta increta, percreta, and accreta.

An important risk factor of placenta accreta is placenta previa in the presence of a uterine scar. Placenta previa is an independent risk factor for placenta accreta.Additional reported risk factors for placenta accreta include increased maternal age and multiparity, other prior uterine surgery, prior uterine curettage,uterine irradiation, Asherman syndrome, uterine leiomyomata, uterine anomalies, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and smoking. (1,2) Maternal morbidity and mortality can occur because of severe and sometimes life-threatening hemorrhage, which often requires blood transfusion also and rates of maternal death are increased for women with PAS. Additionally, patients with PAS are more likely to require hysterectomy at the time of delivery or during the postpartum period and have longer hospital stays states.(3) According to FIGO Classification of PAS Disorders 2019 There are three grades. Grade 1: abnormally adherent placenta (placenta adherent or accreta) - attached directly to the surface of the middle layer of the uterine wall (myometrium) without invading it, Grade 2: abnormally invasive placenta (increta) - invasion into the myometrium and Grade 3: abnormally invasive placenta (percreta) invasion may reach surrounding pelvic tissues, vessels and organs.(4) Nowadays, fertility sparing and conservative methods can be applied.

Testicular torsion is a scrotal emergency that results in impaired blood supply to the testis and ischemia of the testis as a result of the rotation of the spermatic cord around itself. The etiology of testicular torsion is not clear, but various predisposing factors are responsible for the occurrence of testicular torsion.

Recently, with the discovery of ""Toll-Like Receptors"" (TLRs), new horizons have been opened in the field of innate immune system-related diseases.

Objective: To mediate the relationship between testicular torsion and TLR4 receptors.

Material-Method: Testicular specimens of patients who developed testicular ischemia after testicular torsion and underwent orchiectomy between 2012-2022 were reached.

The experimental arm of EC-TX combines several strategies: the combination of EC will be administered every 2 weeks as a dose-dense regimen, the combination of TX can also be considered as dose-dense due to the weekly application of paclitaxel. Furthermore there is clinical evidence, that a combination of capecitabine and Paclitaxel provide synergistic effects with improved tumour response. A randomized phase III study could demonstrate a survival benefit of a combination of capecitabine with Docetaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer. This synergistic effect is probably based on the preclinical observed taxane-mediated up-regulation of thymidine phosphorylase in the tumour cell, which give drive to an increased transformation of capecitabine to its active form 5-Fluorouracil. Apart from this synergy, the EC-TX regimen includes now 4 highly active compounds for the treatment of breast cancer. The total doses of Epirubicin and Paclitaxel are identical in both arms.

NCT02001272,['Ovarian Cancer'],2013-12,2020-02,"The current standard of first-line chemotherapy in advanced ovarian cancer is the combination of carboplatin AUC 5mg/mL/min and paclitaxel 175 mg.m-². This combination is feasible in selected elderly patients such as those included in prospective trials. These trials, however, include a minority of the elderly population. In wider selection of patients \>70 years old, the standard carboplatin-paclitaxel regimen has been shown to induce an excess of toxicity and premature treatment stopping. For elderly patients thought to be vulnerable and at high risk of toxicity with the standard 3-weekly carboplatin-paclitaxel regimen, other options are used in routine practice. One option is to delete paclitaxel and treat elderly patients with carboplatin as a single agent. An alternative is to use the carboplatin-paclitaxel regimen in a weekly schedule for both drugs such as reported by the MITO (Multicentre Italian Trial in Ovarian Cancer).

To date, there is no randomized trial which could give us some evidence of how to select patients who could benefit most of one or the other regimen described above. The 4th Ovarian Cancer Consensus Conference has indeed recognised the medical unmet need of adapted therapy for elderly patients with ovarian cancer and the necessity of additional research in this population.

Recently, GINECO has described a Geriatric Vulnerability Score (GVS) in a population of elderly patients with advanced ovarian cancer included in a specific multicenter phase II trial. The best proportional hazard model fitting for overall survival identified the following geriatric covariates score as being poor survival risk factors: ADL score \<6, IADL score \<25, HADS score \>14, albuminemia \<35g/L and , lymphopenia \<1G/L. GVS is the sum of these risk factors for each patient. Using a cut off of 3, the GVS identified a group of patients at high risk of severe toxicity, early cessation of treatment, unplanned hospitalization and adverse outcomes.

This international multicentre randomized phase II trial will compare the success rate of delivering 6 courses of chemotherapy with evidence of efficacy and without premature termination for progression, death or unacceptable toxicity of three different chemotherapy regimens in a selected population of elderly patients with a GVS ≥ 3:

* Arm A: Paclitaxel 175mg/m²/3 hours, I.V. and carboplatin AUC 5, I.V. every 3 weeks
* Arm B: Carboplatin monotherapy AUC 5 or 6 every 3 weeks
* Arm C: Weekly paclitaxel 60 mg/m²/1 hour and weekly carboplatin AUC 2 (d1, d8, d15 every 4 weeks)

NCT05182281,"['Osteoporosis', 'Whole Body Vibration']",2015-05-01,2015-08-01,"Osteoporosis is an important public health issue that may result in a high fracture risk in the elderly population. There is general consensus that physical exercise decreases the risk of osteoporotic fractures by reducing the risk of falls and increasing bone strength. Although long-term high-intensity exercise programs have been shown to be successful in early post-menopausal women, a high-intensity exercise program appears to be less attractive to older post-menopausal women and may cause a lack of compliance in the long term and result in injury. Some studies have described falls and fractures as side effects of exercise.Whole-body vibration (WBV) therapy is an easy-to-apply alternative therapy for those who do not wish to initiate or continue pharmacological treatments and cannot perform high-impact exercises and is associated with high patient compliance. WBV therapy is among the promising new interventions for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and is defined as mechanical vibration applied in a standing or supine position without any restrictions on frequency (hertz), amplitude (millimeters), magnitude (vibration acceleration due to gravity, g) and cumulative WBV dose. The evidence obtained from animal studies have shown that WBV can be an effective method for increasing bone mass and improving bone structure and strength. Some human studies have shown that WBV can positively affect BMD and improve neuromuscular parameters associated with falls in post-menopausal women.Small changes in posture can have a significant effect on the extent to which a plantar-based mechanical stimulus is actually transmitted to the spine or hip; the stimulus is likely to be weakened by the inevitable changes in posture, which occur due to aging and osteoporosis. For these reasons, we aimed to examine the effect of high frequency and low-magnitude horizontal vibration therapy in post-menopausal women without being affected by posture in the present study.",60,FEMALE,45 Years,65 Years

Thrombophilia whether genetic or acquired, is a hypercoagulable disorder that may increase the risk of venous thromboembolic events. Clinically, these events are presented as maternal deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. Thrombophilias are also associated with adverse fetal outcomes including intrauterine growth restriction, intrauterine fetal death, severe preeclampsia, placental abruption and recurrent abortions.

Pregnant women who experienced one or more of the above complications are advised to be examined for the presence of the genetic or the acquired form of thrombophilia.

Low molecular weight heparin prophylaxis, an anticoagulant, is advised for pregnant women with a history of thromboembolism, and many experts recommend prophylaxis for pregnant patients with a known thrombophilia and history of adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with these hypercoagulable states.

Physiologic changes in normal pregnancy, including weight gain, increased renal clearance and volume of distribution, may decrease the availability of low molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparin or Dalteparin), or produce a less predictable response in pregnant women compared with nonpregnant women. There are no clear recommendations for use of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin in pregnancy. Clinicians tend to use doses suggested for nonpregnant patients. Regarding pregnant patients taking enoxaparin or dalteparin, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that ""because of the lack of data regarding adequate dosing during pregnancy, anti-factor Xa levels may be monitored"".

Two recently published studies demonstrated that plasma anti-factor Xa levels during pregnancy were lower than expected, indicating that many pregnant patients may receive a subprophylactic dosing.

This burden of malnutrition accounts for approximately 50% of under five child deaths in developing countries. The risk of child death is also related to the severity of malnutrition and progressively increases the more the child's growth deviates from WHO Growth Standard, e.g. children with height-for-age \<-3 Z scores from the standard have a four fold increased mortality risk compared to children within one Z score of the growth standard mean. Underweight in children for 18.7% of the global disability-adjusted life years in children less than five years of age. Childhood malnutrition is a pervasive problem in Bangladesh with 43% of children less than five years stunted in 2004 and 38% in urban child populations. An establish approach to promoting appropriate breastfeeding practices is through the use of local peer counsellors to provide information and to support to mothers. A recent study has conducted on pioneering research on this approach in Bangladesh.. The main aim of the study is to use a Cluster Randomized Control Trial (CRCT) to collect high-level evidence of whether peer counselling of women to promote appropriate breastfeeding and complementary feeding can improve feeding practices, child growth and reduce the prevalence of malnutrition in their children.

The investigators will use a community-based Cluster Randomized Control Trial (CRCT) to examine the impact of a peer counselling infant feeding education program starting in the third trimester of pregnancy to one year after delivery, to improve child feeding practices, child growth and reduce the prevalence of malnutrition in their children. This will result in two study groups. The outcome assessments will be made on a cohort of infant-mother dyads measured at baseline and at follow up visits because the investigators expect a likely high correlation between baseline and follow up outcome measures, thus making this approach the most efficient study design. Outcome assessments will be conducted with all the mother-infant pairs recruited in the community clusters in the study, with an expected total of 1950 mother-infant days (975 in each treatment group). The peer counseling education will be offered to eligible pregnant women identified by household surveys over 3 months in each community cluster in the intervention group. Using a similar approach to recruitment, a cohort of mother-infant dyads, who will receive standard maternal and child health care programs, will be identified in the control clusters.

Data will be collected on anthropometry, feeding practices and hygiene and caring practices etc. The investigators will report the results for 2-sided 5% tests for the primary trial outcome. Secondary analyses will examine each outcome variable (stunting, height-for-age, feeding patterns, and mean nutrient intakes) taking account of the repeated measurements within children by using separate mixed models. The investigators will use linear mixed models for continuous outcomes (e.g. height-for-age Z) and generalized linear mixed models for non-continuous outcomes (e.g. logistic mixed models for binary outcomes e.g. percentage exclusively breastfeeding).

Some children's bodies produce these hormones before the normal age and start puberty too early. This condition is known as precocious puberty.

The hormones responsible for the onset of puberty come from the pituitary gland and the ovaries. The hormones from the pituitary gland act on the ovaries to produce different hormones that cause the breasts to grow, pubic hair to develop, and menstruation.

Many children with precocious puberty can be treated with a medication known as lutenizing hormone-releasing hormone analog (Lupron, Histerelin, Deslorelin). This drug is made in a laboratory and is designed to act like the natural hormone LHRH, which is made in the pituitary gland. The drug causes the pituitary gland to decrease the amount of hormones it is releasing and thereby decrease the amount of hormones released by the ovaries. However, some girls already have low levels of pituitary hormones and yet their ovaries still produce hormones. Researchers do not believe that LHRH analog therapy will work for these children.

Testolactone is a drug that acts directly on the ovary. It works by preventing the last step of estrogen production in the ovary. The goal of this treatment is to stop estrogen production and delay the onset of puberty until the normal age.

Researchers will give patients with LHRHa resistant precocious puberty Testolactone for six months. If the initial treatment is successful and patients do not experience very bad side effects, they will continue to receive the medication until puberty is desired.

NCT04290312,['Absorption'],2018-02-01,2020-02-24,"Plant derived foods contain large quantities of non-nutrient phytochemicals that have been extensively studied for their beneficial health effects on the prevention of chronic diseases. Although research on their health effects is abundant, our knowledge on absorption and bioavailability is yet narrow and in some cases zero. The concept of bioavailability involves the identification of the fraction of administered compounds that can reach plasma and body tissues in an unchanged form. The bioactivity of components in foods that are part of our nutrition, either as parent foods or as food supplements, is directly related to bioavailability, the latter being a necessary step to prove efficacy.

Mastiha Oil (MO) is extracted from the resin of Pistacia Lentiscus var. Chia (of the Anacardiaceae family), a concentrated source of monoterpenes (e.g., α-pinene, β-pinene, β-myrcene) and triterpenes (e.g., mastihadienonic acid, isomastihadienonic acid), and to a lesser extent of plant sterols, simple phenols and approximately 10% MO (Assimopoulou, \& Papageorgiou, 2005, Paraschos et al, 2007, Kaliora, Mylona, Chiou, Petsios, \& Andrikopoulos, 2004). MO is a 100% natural product used as a food additive and flavoring and it is manufactured according to the legal standards that make it suitable for human consumption. Its nutritional analysis is presented in Supplementary Table 1. A total of 90 components have been detected in MO (50% monoterpene hydrocarbons, 20% oxygenated monoterpenes, 25% sesquiterpenes). Monoterpenes seem to exhibit beneficial health effects contributing to mechanisms of inflammation and oxidative stress (Subramaniyan, 2017; Madhuri, \& Naik, 2017).

Research upon the bioavailability of monoterpenes in humans is limited. Herein, we aimed at investigating the bioavailability of the main monoterpenes of MO in humans for the first time. To this end, a novel GC-MS-MS method was employed, since the tandem MS technique can help overcome matrix difficulties. Additionally, based on the existing data regarding the antioxidant activity of monoterpenes, the effect on human antioxidant capacity was evaluated applying the serum oxidisabilty assay.

Not only the low immunization, but also the dropout of immunization and the delayed immunization from the recommended immunization schedule are prevalent and high in Africa. The most common reason for the incomplete vaccination is that caregivers thought the children had already been fully immunized (44.8%), according to Nigeria Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) conducted in 2016/2017.

Caregivers' misconception of the complete immunization can be attributed to the complicated immunization schedule. In Nigeria, infants are supposed to receive 9 different types of vaccines at 5 different times within the first year since the births. To make things more complicated, the vaccine schedule changes over time; for example in Nigeria, the new vaccine, inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was introduced in 2015 to be received at 14 weeks after births, and rotavirus vaccine and meningococcal A vaccine are scheduled for the introduction in 2019.

In this complicated and rapidly-changing environment regarding vaccination schedule, the goal of the study is to improve the understanding of vaccination completion and children's vaccination status among caregivers, which can then lead to the improved rate of full vaccination among children.

Objectives The main objectives of this study are to understand the impact of providing the general and tailored information on the vaccination schedule and vaccination status of women's children on the vaccine take-up. In this study, the investigators focus on women who has a child who is 12 months old or younger.

Hypothesis

The main hypothesis of this proposed study are as follows:

1. Information on vaccination among caregivers: the general and tailored information on vaccination schedule and child's vaccination status, improves the knowledge on benefit and understanding of vaccination completion, vaccination schedule and the vaccination status of the children among caregivers
2. Full immunization rate: through the improved knowledge level on the concept of vaccination completion and their children's vaccination status, the proposed study increases the full immunization rate among children",400,FEMALE,N/A,N/A

One way to prevent skeletal muscle loss is to improve dietary intake of the elderly. It has already been shown that ingestion of dietary protein stimulates muscle protein synthesis and inhibits muscle protein breakdown, resulting in an overall positive net protein balance. However, the impact of fat (as part of the meal) on dietary protein-induced muscle protein synthesis remains largely unknown. Based on previous studies by other research groups, we hypothesize that fat further stimulates the muscle anabolic response to protein ingestion.

Objective: The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a single meal-like amount of protein with or without fat on postprandial muscle protein synthesis rates in healthy elderly men. Furthermore, as a secondary objective, we will assess digestion and absorption kinetics.

The investigators rely on acceleromyography (AMG) of a peripheral nerve/muscle to assess the patients' breathing capability at the end of surgery. It is possible that respiratory complications after surgery (e.g. desaturation and atelectasis) are related to the lack of diaphragm activity.

A previous trial by our study group links the use of sugammadex, a novel selective relaxant binding agent (SRBA) for reversal of neuromuscular blockade, to an increase in diaphragm electrical activity, compared to reversal with neostigmine. Our hypothesis is that by making nicotinergic acetylcholine receptors free from rocuronium in the diaphragmatic neuromuscular junctions, instead of increasing the amount of acetylcholine (like neostigmine does), sugammadex will result in a better neuromuscular coupling. This may have its subsequent effects on the central control of breathing, influencing the balance between intercostal and diaphragm activity.

The investigators now propose a study in rats, where the investigators will use Functional Respiratory Imaging (FRI, property of FluidDA n.v., Groeningenlei 132, B-2550 Kontich) to assess regional lung ventilation after sugammadex, neostigmine or spontaneous reversal.

NCT03904446,['Uterine Atony With Hemorrhage'],2019-06-08,2021-02-15,"Postpartum hemorrhage remains a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide, even in high income countries. Uterine atony is estimated to cause 70-80% of postpartum hemorrhage. Prolonged labor and augmented labor are known risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage. In attempts to reduce the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, particularly in patients with known risks factors, it is essential to optimize preventative practices in order to reduce the rates postpartum hemorrhage.

Although oxytocin is considered the first line therapy for preventing and treating uterine atony, early consideration of additional prophylactic uterotonic agents may be indicated in women with prior oxytocin exposure given oxytocin receptor desensitization and down regulation.

As such, investigators sought to examine whether multimodal prophylactic uterotonics (standard oxytocin + methylergonovine), in patients who are increased risk of developing postpartum hemorrhage (specifically laboring patients who ultimately require a cesarean section) would benefit from the addition of prophylactic uterotonics. The clinical rational for administration of multimodal prophylactic uterotonics at the time of cesarean delivery in laboring patients is three-fold: to decrease the incidence of uterine atony, to decrease the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, decrease the number of uterotonics required at the time of cesarean section.

The primary outcome will be to evaluate the need for additional uterotonic agents (Methylergonovine, Carboprost, Misoprostol) at the time of delivery.

Secondary outcomes will include the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage (quantitative blood loss \>1 liter), surgical assessment of uterine tone four minutes following delivery of the placenta, preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin, the need for a blood transfusion, intensive care unit admission, uterine infection (endometritis).",160,FEMALE,18 Years,50 Years

NCT00949481,['Postpartum Period'],2009-02,2009-08,"The rationale for the study stems from the goal of reducing the very high unmet need for family planning among women in their first year postpartum. It is understood that the reason this need is so high in general is because postpartum women do not always ""demand"" family planning services, and family planning providers do not always ""supply"" services to postpartum (amenorrheic) women who do ""demand"" them. To address these supply and demand problems, corresponding supply and demand solutions will be tested.

1. Demand Generating Strategy-Integrate into Immunization Services Following birth, return to fertility among postpartum women is dependent on many factors. These include time since last birth, breastfeeding intensity, and menstrual status. However, when and how fertility returns is often misunderstood by women. For instance, many women think that they can not get pregnant before their menses return, or that as long as they are breastfeeding they are protected from pregnancy. Educating women about their return to fertility following giving birth, and reminding women about the importance of birth spacing for their health and the health of their children is the focus of the demand-generating strategy.

   To reach postpartum women with these messages a demand generating activity at immunization clinics will be conducted, as immunization services are well attended. Based on the recommended immunization schedules for infants, women will make several visits to these clinics throughout the course of their first year postpartum, which provides an ideal opportunity to ""hit"" them with family planning messages more than once.

   To aid providers of immunization services in their delivery of family planning messages, a simple job aid was developed. The job aid takes providers through a series of 3 questions that will allow the provider to determine a mother's immediate risk for pregnancy (based on LAM criteria). If a woman is currently at risk for pregnancy, it prompts the provider to give a healthy timing and spacing message and to make a referral to the family planning clinic. If a woman is not currently at risk for pregnancy, the job aid helps the provider instruct the mother about when her risk for pregnancy will change, and therefore when she will need to seek family planning services to achieve proper birth spacing (should this be desirable to the mother).

   Also, in the family planning (FP) clinics that are located in the same facility as the immunization clinic, providers will be given the pregnancy checklist. This job-aid has already been researched (refer to citations). The purpose of providing it is to make sure that when women are referred to FP clinics by immunization providers, FP providers will supply them with a method. As a consequence, it hoped that by the time women are 9-12 months postpartum, there will be an increase in uptake of non-condom family planning methods.
2. Supply Solution-Diversify Tools Available to Rule-Out Pregnancy The supply strategy focuses on giving providers the tools to give contraceptive methods to women who are amenorrheic. As recommended by the WHO, it is standard practice for FP providers to rule out the possibility of pregnancy before providing many types of methods to their clients. The presence of menses is often used to make this determination. However, return of menses can be delayed for many months in the postpartum period, limiting a provider's ability to supply postpartum women with contraceptive methods. To overcome this challenge, the Pregnancy Checklist was developed. It is a job-aid designed to rule out pregnancy based on client responses to questions concerning her recent sexual and reproductive history. Urine pregnancy testing is another viable option for ruling out pregnancy in non-menstruating FP clients, especially in situations where providers feel they cannot trust women to answer questions honestly. Thus, family planning clinics will be provided with free pregnancy test strips, and the change in same day uptake of FP methods will be measured.

Hypotheses

1. Providing family planning messages to women attending immunization clinics with their child will cause them to seek family planning services in a greater proportion at 9-12 postpartum.
2. The availability of free pregnancy testing will increase same day method provision for new and restarting family planning clients.",14050,FEMALE,N/A,N/A

NCT03903146,"['Breast Feeding, Exclusive']",2016-03-10,2018-10-31,"Childhood obesity is a serious problem in the United States, as it increases the risk for various cardiometabolic, pulmonary, and psychosocial complications for children, which often continue into adulthood. Examination of disparities in early childhood obesity among ethnic groups shows that Hispanic infants/children have higher rates of overweight and obesity than children/infants of other races/ethnicities. According to the most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2014), the prevalence of high weight for recumbent length (≥95th percentile) among infant and toddlers from birth to 2 years was 6.6% in Whites, 8.4% in Blacks, and 9.4% in Hispanics. Furthermore, the percentages of children ages 2 through 5 years who are overweight or obese (Body Mass Index \[BMI\] ≥ 85th) were 20.9% among non-Hispanic Whites, 21.9% among non-Hispanic Blacks, and 29.8% among Hispanics. These data suggest that ethnic disparities in childhood obesity prevalence have their origins in the earliest stages of life.

Bergmann et al. reported that infants that received early formula artificial feeding by 3 months had significantly higher BMIs and thicker skin fold than exclusively breastfed infants, and from 6 months on, compared with breastfed children, a consistently higher proportion of artificially-fed children exceeded the 90th and 97th percentile of BMI and skin folder thickness reference values. Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), defined as exclusive infant feeding with breast milk without any additional food or drink, is the feeding option engendering greatest nutrition and health, imparting enhanced glucose management and reductions in early childhood obesity.

Hispanic mothers in the U.S. are more likely to supplement with formula in the first 2 days of life, compared with Black and White U.S. mothers (Hispanic 33%; Black 28%; White 22%). Additionally, a common feeding practice among Hispanic mothers is the early introduction of solids including ethnic food. The introduction of formula or complementary food in breastfed Hispanic infants produces an overfeeding problem that leads to childhood obesity. In a study published by this team of investigators on infant feeding management in Hispanic women living in Kentucky was reported that even when 51% of the group of Hispanic mothers initiated EBF during hospital stay, only 22% continued EBF at 4 months after birth. These trends underscore the critical need for intervention to support EBF in this population.

Objectives: There is great opportunity and immense need to empower vulnerable, at-risk Hispanic mother/infant dyads to prevent and manage childhood obesity by increasing duration and EBF and delaying the introduction of complementary food. The primary aim of this pilot study was to determinate the feasibility and evaluate the clinical impact of a novel, tailored, culturally and linguistically appropriate community-based intervention. The intervention was delivered by Hispanics bilingual/bicultural team of an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) and a peer counselor (PC) and was tested in terms of its influence on key modifiable factors that are positively associated with increasing breastfeeding duration and exclusivity: (a) mother's breastfeeding intention; (b) breastfeeding self-efficacy; and (c) perceived social support. Specific aims for this study are:

Aim 1: Determine the feasibility of the intervention. This aim is designed to answer the following important research questions:

Q-1: Is the planned recruitment period sufficient to enroll the targeted number of participants? Q-2: What percent of treatment group participants will complete all sessions of the intervention? Q-3: What percent of participants will be retained in the study until the conclusion? Q-4: What factors are associated with intervention adherence and study retention?

Aim 2: Evaluate the clinical impact of the intervention. The following hypotheses will be tested:

Hypothesis #1: Women in the intervention group will have higher intention to breastfeed during the pre-natal period and will perceive greater self-efficacy and social support during postnatal period, compared with the usual care group.

Hypothesis #2: Women in the intervention group will be more likely to initiate EBF during their post-delivery in-hospital stay than those in the usual care group.

Hypothesis #3: Among those who practice EBF during their hospital stay, women in the intervention group will be more likely to continue EBF for six months than women in the usual care group.

Hypothesis #4: Women in the intervention group will have longer time to introduction of complementary food to their infants compared with the usual care group.",39,FEMALE,N/A,N/A

NCT01300676,['Postmenopausal Syndrome'],2009-03,2010-01,"Despite evidence supporting the benefits of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), only 15% of postmenopausal women currently use HRT (1). The leading reasons why women refuse or discontinue HRT are fear of malignancy, side effects such as vaginal bleeding, weight gain, depressed mood, and breast tenderness, and social reasons such as regarding menopause as a natural transition, not as a disease that requires treatment. Millions of women expressed their concern on the safety of hormone replacement therapy since the data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study was released, which reported an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, stroke and thromboembolic disease with conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate compared with placebo (2). The study has also demonstrated that quality of life (3) and cognition (4) were no better in the HRT group than the placebo group. In view of these problems, women are increasingly turning to alternative therapies in an effort to manage their menopausal symptoms (1).

Menopause is associated with decreasing sex steroid levels. The effect of menopause on circulating androgen levels has been studied by several investigators with variable findings. The levels of testosterone and androstenedione appear to show a small but significant decrease just before or within the first 2 years after menopause, with a decrease in testosterone amounting to approximately 15% (5,6). Unlike the abrupt decrease in estradiol levels associated with menopause, circulating testosterone, DHEA, and DHEAS levels decrease more gradually, beginning in the years before menopause and continuing thereafter (6,7). As a consequence, some women may experience symptoms of androgen decrease in the period before cessation of menses. By giving Tualang Honey to these postmenopausal women, it is postulated that the symptoms of androgen deficiency or menopausal symptoms should be reduced.

The investigators have also reported that tualang honey given to ovariectomised rats, an animal model for postmenopausal states for two weeks significantly increased the free testosterone and progesterone plasma levels, but no significant effect was seen in the beta-estradiol level. There were significant increased in the thickness of vaginal epithelium and vaginal epithelial-muscular layers. Proliferation of the squamous epithelium with vacuolation of some of the squamous cells were noted in the honey treated animals implying that there were increased in mucopolysacharide content. Uterine weight, endometrial and circular muscle thickness were significantly increased in honey treated animal with cystic changes noted over the glands (8).

To date, there are no clinical studies looking at the effects of Tualang Honey on perimenopausal women. In view of the initial evidence that it is a phytoestrogen from animal studies and has androgenic properties as well, it should have a beneficial effect to these women in terms of improvement in their menopausal symptoms, changes in their endogenous hormonal profile and increase in bone mineral density.",79,FEMALE,45 Years,65 Years

Women will be enrolled at 36-weeks gestation and greater. At the time of vaginal delivery, women will be randomized to receive either immediate post-placenta insertion of the LNG-IUS or routine insertion at 4-8 weeks post-partum. All patients will return at 4-6 weeks post-insertion and 6 months post-partum to confirm correct position of the LNG-IUS. The primary outcome of this sub-study is the number of LNG-IUS in the correct position at 6-months. Secondary outcomes include assessing the safety of post-placental LNG-IUS insertion and difference in acceptability and symptoms experienced by participants. This is a sub-study of the Contraceptive Choice Project, a prospective cohort study that aims to improve the use of long-acting contraception by removing financial barriers which has already enrolled over 5,000 patients. Association of this study with CHOICE offers unique advantages including infrastructure to support subject recruitment, retention and completion of follow-up as well as covering the cost of LNG-IUS devices.

We hypothesize that, despite higher expulsion rates, women randomized to receive the LNG-IUS immediately after placenta delivery will have higher rates of LNG-IUS continuation due to poor rates of follow up in the interval insertion group. This is likely to be particularly noticeable in our patient population, which is largely uninsured with poor access to healthcare. Further, typical symptoms of LNG-IUS insertion include bleeding and cramping, which may be disguised by the post-partum period.

NCT01945476,['Breast Cancer'],2013-09,2014-08,"Normally, higher levels of preoperational stress or anxiety affect behavior and recovery after the operation. Moreover, patients undergoing mastectomy are usually young women, and this demographic is known to experience higher levels of stress and anxiety than any other. Anesthetizing patients involves more than just anesthesia in operation; it also includes all of the preoperative treatments for optimizing a patient's condition and promoting quick postoperative recovery. Pharmacological premedication for anxiolysis or amnesia before anesthesia has been a common means of sedation that many studies have investigated. However, such studies have focused on alleviating patients' anxiety and on how far patients can obey induction for sedation; there has been no research on post-operational prognoses, the ultimate purpose of reducing anxiety.

The well-known effect of pharmacological premedication is to reduce the capacity of the anesthetic. However, it is not confirmed whether this effect leads to better recovery after anesthesia, as this question has not been researched. Furthermore, recently some have argued strongly that premedication actually prolongs recovery and that it does not need to be applied to every patient. Recently, therefore, the use of pharmacological premedication has been left to the discretion of institutes or doctors in many cases.

Among types of premedication, midazolam belongs to the class of short-acting benzodiazepines and is frequently used, as it induces meaningful anterograde amnesia and causes fewer aftereffects such as respiratory problems. In addition, its effects have already been demonstrated. However, research on the improvement of functional health after anesthesia-i.e., patients' quick return to normal life-is still poor and needs to be advanced.

When measuring the degree of recovery, recent studies tend to focus on measuring how quickly patients are able to return to normal life rather than the recovery of specific symptoms. To this end, the most widely used method is the Quality of Recovery 40 (QoR-40) survey. It has a total of 40 items, which are classified into five categories: emotional state, physical comfort, psychological support, physical independence, and pain. Questions are answered using a 5-point scale, with 1 being worst and 5 being best. It takes 6.3 minutes on average to complete, and its test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and split-half coefficient have led it to be recognized as the most effective survey method. Moreover, it has been used in many studies investigating how the type of operation, method of anesthesia, additional medication, and gender affect anesthesia and the operation. Its validity for such research has been verified.

Therefore, investigators can investigate the degree of postoperational functional recovery through the QoR-40 by comparing cases in which an operation is performed with or without midazolam.",82,FEMALE,20 Years,65 Years

It was found out that GDM occurs more frequently in overweight women but also in women with a history of certain conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

NCT03289676,['HIV/AIDS'],2017-09-06,2018-10-23,"HIV has transformed into a chronic illness due to the advent of effective treatments in the absence of a cure. As a result, the prevalence of non-AIDS defining cancers (NADCs), including lung cancer, has increased three-fold among people living with HIV. NADCs now account for 50% of all cancers among the people. Smoking is one of the major contributing factors to lung cancer and smoking prevalence is substantially higher in this population than the general U.S. population. Smoking prevalence does not differ by gender among people living with HIV. Women of color, particularly African American women represent the majority of women living with HIV (WLHIV) followed by Latinas. WLHIV smoke at a rate almost 3 times higher than that for the general U.S. female population (e.g., 42% vs. 16%). The proposed study has two phases: 1) the development of a storytelling narrative communication (SNC) intervention that will be added to an established HIV-tailored smoking cessation intervention and 2) a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the HIV-tailored intervention plus the SNC Intervention compared with the HIV-tailored intervention only. The investigators will develop narrative videos with three to five WLHIV who will be talking about their personal struggles with smoking and success in quitting. Preliminary study revealed that the established HIV-tailored intervention was effective only for short-term (≤ 2 months) abstinence. Many relapsed to smoking between the 2nd and 6th month of quitting. The investigators propose that the SNC intervention will be an effective strategy to sustain their quit efforts for long-term abstinence (≥ 6 months). A total of 60 WLHIV will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the experimental arm (a combination of HIV-tailored and SNC interventions) or the control arm (HIV-tailored intervention only). Specific aims of the study are to 1) Identify SNC intervention components that are rated high in transport and identification for use as an enhancement to an HIV-tailored smoking cessation intervention; 2) Determine the feasibility and acceptability of the SNC intervention for WLHIV by assessing the rate of recruitment and retention for feasibility and the degree of transport and identification for acceptability; and 3) Establish an effect size of HIV-tailored and SNC interventions for smoking cessation in comparison with the HIV-tailored smoking cessation intervention only for WLHIV, for subsequent grant applications.",53,FEMALE,18 Years,65 Years

When pain is present most patients are currently treated with physical therapy, but evidence of its effectiveness is still low and a gold standard does not yet exist. A downside of physical therapy is that patients have to undergo the therapy regularly and treatment might even has to continue for years after symptoms and treatment started. Another treatment option is a compression vest with the potential, apart from reducing symptoms, to improve self-efficacy in patients because they decide when to wear it without the need to visit therapists. However effectiveness of the compression vest has not yet been objectified in studies.

NCT00914576,['Healthy'],2011-04,2013-07,"Oxidative stress has been implicated in playing a pathogenic role in many disease processes, especially in age-related disorders. It has been hypothesized that antioxidative agents such as vitamins and minerals, which are capable of scavenging free radicals, may reduce oxidative stress and may, in turn, be beneficial for patients with age-related disorders. Based on this hypothesis, several different combinations of vitamins have been introduced, all targeting at reducing oxidative stress. However, the in-vivo determination of the antioxidative properties of a certain drug or vitamin combination are hard to determine. In the current study, the researchers propose to investigate the effect of VITAMAC®, a combination of vitamins and minerals, in a systemic in-vivo inflammation model.

In the present study, the infusion of LPS, which is a cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria and a major mediator in the pathogenesis of septic shock, will be used as a standardized experimental model of systemic inflammation in humans. Given that inflammation is associated with enhanced oxidative stress and widespread endothelial dysfunction, the LPS model is well suitable for determination of the antioxidative effects of VITAMAC®. As a main outcome parameter, the vascular reactivity of retinal vessels to systemic hyperoxia (induced by breathing 100% oxygen) will be tested in presence or absence of the antioxidant combination.",40,MALE,18 Years,35 Years

It has been suggested that free vitamin D may be better because it may be more biologically available.

There are also some uncertainties about how we treat vitamin D deficiency. A single dose is attractive because it is certain that the patient has had the dose and there is no requirement for ongoing compliance, but it is still not clear what the best dose is to give. Also, recent studies have highlighted that high dose vitamin D supplementation may increase the risk of falling in older populations.

The investigators believe that studying how free vitamin D responds to different bolus doses is the best way address some of the current research gaps, including what is the best biomarker of vitamin D status, what is the mechanism of vitamin D toxicity and what is a safe bolus dose to treat deficiency.

The investigators will study changes in total and free 25(OH)D, and also clinical response, to three different bolus doses of vitamin D (50 000IU, 150 000IU and 500 000IU) in 84 vitamin D deficient postmenopausal women, over a three month period with 5 study visits.

Aldosterone promoted end organ damage is mainly found in the cardiovascular system and the kidney. Inflammation and activation of different factors promotes fibroblast growth and matrix production resulting in myocardial fibrosis, vascular remodelling and renal fibrosis.

MetSyn and aldosterone are cardiovascular risk factors and it is of crucial importance to note that there is a connection between MetSyn and aldosterone. Other cross sectional studies show a direct correlation of aldosterone levels and impaired glucose metabolism in patients with and without the MetSyn. Taken together, aldosterone influences essential parameters of the MetSyn. Coincidentally parameters of the MetSyn are stimulus for an increased aldosterone synthesis, i.e. visceral adipocytes.

In large scale clinical trials - RALES, EPHESUS, 4E - inhibition of MR has proven to be beneficial in patients with congestive heart failure and post myocardial infarction and this result has been confirmed for diabetic patients, who are known to have an increased cardiovascular risk.

There is only very limited data on the impact of MR inhibition on metabolic, endocrine, and inflammatory parameters in patients with MetSyn, who have not yet suffered from cardiovascular events.",42,MALE,18 Years,N/A

The hormonal control of multiple follicular growth and maturation is a critical part of ART procedures since it maximizes the yield of embryos to be transferred, thus increasing the cumulative pregnancy rate.

Recent studies have shown the efficacy of myo-inositol (MI) supplementation as a simple and highly effective treatment in order to improve oocyte quality in patients undergoing IVF. Indeed, it was previously shown that MI follicular fluid (FF) concentration is a reliable predictor of oocyte quality. High MI concentration in the FF directly correlates with high oocyte and embryo quality.

Another stereoisomer of Inositol was successfully used into clinical practice D-chiro-inositol (DCI). In particular, DCI supplementation was used to restore ovulation in hyperglycemic PCOS patients.

It is a common problem in women that can significantly impact quality of life, with up to 30% developing SUI at some point in their lifetime.

The most commonly utilized treatments for SUI include either pelvic floor (Kegel) exercises, or surgery. Many women find Kegel exercises unsatisfactory, but are reluctant to undergo a surgical procedure. Also, women who are poor candidates for surgery have limited options if Kegel exercises are unsuccessful. Over the years, there have been numerous attempts to develop effective non-surgical alternatives for treating SUI, but the results have been variable and the available data on efficacy limited.

A new intravaginal incontinence pessary (Uresta) has been developed for treating stress incontinence, and is currently available in Canada via a medical distributor. The self-positioning device is initially fitted by a healthcare provider, but then can subsequently placed by the patient as needed. Uresta is designed to be easily inserted into the vagina and spontaneously fall into position, providing support beneath the urethra. A single, uncontrolled study of 21 women showed that Uresta significantly reduces urinary incontinence measures, with no reported complications. Using questionnaires, a 47% reduction in self-reported SUI symptoms was demonstrated. Pad weight following a pad test, an objective assessment of urine loss, showed a 50% reduction in leakage.

This trial is intended to be a short-term assessment of the efficacy of the Uresta device, using a placebo arm in order to remove any of the possible sources of patient biases. The placebo (""sham"") group will be obtained by placing a flexible silastic ring (inactivated Estring) high in the vagina where it will not alter urethral forces. The aim is to unequivocally determine whether the Uresta device provides the necessary urethral support to stop urine leakage from stress incontinence.

NCT00402844,['Pelvic Organ Prolapse'],2006-08,N/A,"Pelvic organ prolapse is characterized by a lack of pelvic floor support causing the pelvic organs and vaginal walls to protrude. For decades, suture repair techniques have been the primary choice of surgical treatment when indicated.

The notion of reinforcing pelvic floor defects using biomaterial implants is not an exclusively contemporary idea. Traditional surgical techniques are frequently associated with unsatisfying anatomical recurrence rates and over the years sporadic attempts have been made to introduce novel surgical techniques using a variety of biomaterials as support with varying success. It is plausible that inherently weak, or damaged, pelvic floor supportive tissues need to be reinforced by a permanent support to avoid the high rates of recurrences commonly described using traditional techniques. However, use of biomaterials in pelvic reconstructive surgery has become widespread in just a few years despite a lack of clinical safety data, or compelling clinical evidence demonstrating that it improves outcomes compared to traditional suture techniques.

It is likely that biomaterials need to be ""anchored"" in tissues not afflicted by the disease, in order to provide the intended pelvic floor support. This has given rise to transvaginal surgical techniques using a transobturator approach passing the mesh through the arcus tendineous fascia pelvis, or the sacrospinous ligaments through a transgluteal approach. Already commercially available implant materials are in need of patient safety documentation, both when considering the surgical techniques by which these materials are placed in the body as well as the actual materials. Complication rates and perioperative morbidity using these surgical routes in pelvic organ prolapse surgery are generally unknown.

The aim of the present study was to assess the long term morbidity, and describe the complications, associated with transvaginal mesh repair of pelvic organ prolapse using the PROLIFT®-system.",250,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A

The kidneys filter extra water and waste out of the blood and make urine. CKD is a long-term, progressive decrease in the kidneys' ability to work properly.

The study treatment BAY3283142 is under development for treating CKD. It works by activating a protein called soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) that generates cGMP - a molecule that relaxes blood vessels and is thought to have beneficial effects in CKD.

The participants of this study will be healthy and will have no benefit from the intake of the study treatment. However, the study will provide information on how to use BAY3283142 in subsequent studies in people with CKD.

The main purpose of this study is to learn how safe the study treatment BAY3283142 is and how it affects the body in comparison to placebo when given as single and multiple amounts in healthy male participants in Japan. A placebo is a treatment that looks like a medicine but does not have any medicine in it.

To do this, the study team will compare the number of participants who have medical problems after taking BAY3283142 with those participants who take placebo. These medical problems are called adverse events. The study doctors and their team keep track of all medical problems that happen in studies, even if they do not think they might be related to the study treatments.

Another purpose of this study is to learn how the study treatment BAY3283142 moves into, through, and out of the body. To answer this, the study doctors and their team will take blood samples from the participants and measure:

* The average highest level of BAY3283142 in the blood (also called Cmax)
* The average total level of BAY3283142 in the blood (also called AUC).

Oxytocin is commonly used for labor induction, as well as during the third stage of labor to minimize the risk of primary PPH. At delivery, it is imperative that the uterus responds effectively to parenteral oxytocin. Poor response to oxytocin following delivery is commonly due to prolonged labor with oxytocin augmentation that is known to ""desensitize"" the myometrium. Despite the option of several second line uterotonic agents, none of them are as effective as oxytocin in controlling PPH. Given that poor uterine muscle contraction is the root cause of both failed induction or augmentation (leading to a CD in labor) and uterine atony (leading to PPH), there is an urgent and clinically important need to investigate novel methods to enhance oxytocin-induced myometrial contractions.

Propranolol, a beta adrenergic receptor agonist, has the potential to improve myometrial contractions by virtue of its ability to inhibit catecholamine production. The investigators plan to investigate the effects of propranolol in both naive and desensitized myometrium, in order to better understand its potential role in improving labor induction and reducing the risk of PPH following oxytocin exposure during labor.

This clinical trial is based on the concept proposed in countries like France more than a decade ago, that chemotherapy or radiotherapy cause the tumor cells to release certain signals that favor the activation of the immune system against cancer. Therefore, the combined use of chemotherapy with vaccination with dendritic cells would provide the immune system with greater antitumor response capacity, taking advantage of the release of said signals to initiate a series of processes that would be reflected in the activation of T lymphocytes capable of destroying the remaining cells of the tumor. To determine the specificity of the response evoked by the adoptive transfer of autologous DCs, in each patient the degree of recognition of the tumor by the immune system before and after said procedure will be evaluated. These results will be compared with those of patients who participated in a control group.

Hypothesis Adoptive transfer of autologous DCs generated in vitro, in patients with stage IIA-IV breast cancer who receive neoadjuvant therapy with Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide, is a safe procedure that stimulates anti-tumor immune responses in treated patients.

NCT02530580,['Healthy'],2016-02,2016-07,"GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human brain. For years, drugs that enhance its effects (e.g., benzodiazepines such as diazepam/Valium) have been used to treat various diseases such as epilepsy, insomnia, anxiety or movement disorders. However, the use of these medications is often compromised because of their side effects, such as sleepiness, memory problems, and addiction.

Therefore, effort has been made to develop drugs that act more selectively in the brain to exert the positive therapeutic effects and are devoid of the unwanted side effects. AZD7325 is one of these drugs. It has been tested in more than 700 people and so far proved to be generally well tolerated. Positron emission tomography (PET) study in humans demonstrated that AZD7325 binds to GABA A receptors in the brain after a single dose. Early clinical studies have shown that it has less sedative and cognitive adverse events as compared with a benzodiazepine lorazepam.

The investigators now wish to evaluate if effects of AZD7325 can be objectively measured in healthy volunteers and to establish which of the drug's outcomes could be utilised for further studies in patients with neurological diseases.

The investigators are especially interested in the effects of AZD7325 on manual dexterity and skin sensation of the hand. This can be assessed by a number of simple non-invasive tests of object manipulation and detection of different sensory stimuli such as touch, vibration, or temperature. Recent studies show that healthy individuals who performed better in similar tasks had more GABA in relevant areas of their brain. If performance in these tasks in healthy volunteers can be improved by enhancing GABA effects in the brain with AZD7325, this would create the grounds for the use of this medication to treat symptoms of certain neurological disorders in which motor control and sensation of the hand is impaired (e.g., polyneuropathy).",12,MALE,18 Years,55 Years

The aim of this study is to understand if additional lifestyle support, such as discussions about healthy eating and physical activity provided by a healthcare provider throughout pregnancy can help women achieve weights concordant with gestational recommendations.

The healthcare providers in this study will be Registered Dietitians (RD). The intervention RD will be trained in Healthy Conversations, a supportive method of communication that utilizes open-ended questions to support patient-centered behaviour change. This allows women to explore health issues, identify barriers and discover solutions for improving their own health. This supportive prenatal counselling will occur with the intervention group concurrently while completing lifestyle questionnaires with the study RD. During these conversations, health goals will be made and will be followed up at future visits. The control group will complete the lifestyle questionnaires with the control RD; they will not receive additional lifestyle support at these visits. Women will be randomized into one of the two study groups and will be blinded to their study allocation. All participants will complete two in person visits and two follow-up telephone calls. Data will be collected on diet, physical activity, gestational weight gain, delivery, and infant outcomes.

After this research is complete, the investigators hope to better understand the quantity and quality of additional support that may help women in Alberta achieve guideline concordant weight gain during pregnancy. If interventions can help women gain weight within the guidelines, pregnancy-related complications can be reduced. This information is also aimed at providing a better understanding of healthcare system requirements (i.e., type of providers and care model) in supporting women achieve healthy weights in pregnancy. The findings from this project have the potential to improve prenatal healthcare delivery across the province.",123,FEMALE,20 Years,N/A

Chest pain or discomfort, especially when lying in prone position, increased respiratory effort during exercise, scoliosis, impaired shoulders and kyphotic position are some of the physical signs and symptoms. Unlike pectus excavatum, PC is rarely associated with significant cardiopulmonary involvement except in severe cases. Pectus carinatum is not just a simple aesthetical problem. The effect of patient's self-esteem, body image and confidence can be variable and lead to significant deterioration in mental health. It can be responsible of physical signs and symptoms and also has significant psychological impact. Deformity and its psychological impact tend to worsen during pubertal rapid phases of growth and even during adult life. The management of pectus deformities used to include surgical techniques, however, recently compression brace which is a dynamic orthosis which is custom-fitted, rigid aluminum brace that is adjustable to any thoracic shape is widely applied instead of surgery. Pressure applied to the patient, in the most protruding area of the chest, needed to accomplish a proper shape of the thorax, the pressure of correction can be measured via a pressure measuring device in pounds per square inches (PSI). Treatment choices of surgery or bracing is determined according to pressure of correction and type of deformity. Surgical correction is indicated if the presence of chondro-manubrial type PC and pressure of correction \> 10 PSI. Chest pain or discomfort, especially when lying in prone position, increased respiratory effort during exercise, scoliosis, impaired shoulders and kyphotic position are some of the physical signs and symptoms.

This is a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial designed to address the primary research question: Does bupivacaine lengthen the second stage of labor? The secondary research question is: Is there other evidence of motor blockade attributable to bupivacaine during the second stage of labor?

The investigators know from prior studies that the length of the second stage in nulliparous women delivered at Parkland Hospital without epidural analgesia is 28 minutes. The investigators hypothesize in this now proposed study that epidural analgesia with bupivacaine will significantly increase this baseline from 28 minutes to 37 minutes or more (a 33% increase) thus implicating motor blockade. Baseline data for the Bromage and Breen scores during the second stage as well as the uterine contractility data are not available as these indices of motor blockade have not here-to-fore been studied in this context.

Currently at Parkland Hospital, 82% of nulliparous women undergoing induction of labor at term receive continuous epidural infusions with bupivacaine during the first and second stages of labor.

NCT03313830,['Healthy'],2017-10-07,2020-11-06,"Muscle protein synthesis can be stimulated by ingestion of protein sources, such as whey, casein or soy. Protein supplementation can be useful to restore protein turnover after exercise but also to preserve skeletal muscle mass and function in aging adults. Ingestion of large doses of essential amino acids (EAA) or certain protein supplements may be an effective strategy to induce muscle protein synthesis. However, in many cases, it may not be practical or feasible to consume a large volume of amino acids or protein required for an effective response by muscle. Several evidences show how reduced strength and muscle mass, even in early life, are predictors of early mortality which explicit the importance of developing more effective methods to improve muscle quality. Therefore, identifying the better sources of protein that have higher anabolic potency is of high significance.

The goal of this study is to determine the anabolic potency and efficacy of a new and novel Whey Protein Hydrolysate mixture (WPH) on skeletal muscle protein synthesis in healthy young subjects (age 20-35 yr). Previous studies on rats indicate WPH induces significant increases in muscle protein synthesis compared with carbohydrates or whey-amino acid mixture. WPH contains mostly peptides, which have physiological effects and could be absorbed more rapidly. Preliminary data from preclinical study has also demonstrated that WPH can stimulate muscle protein synthesis at lower doses compared with intact whey proteins. Thus, WPH could be absorbed more rapidly and may maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis. Although there is substantial data on the individual effects of BCCA and intact protein such as whey, there have been no clinical investigations that have explored the efficacy of WPH for stimulating muscle protein synthesis in humans.

Therefore, the investigators propose that WPH will increase muscle protein synthesis.

They will compare the response of WHP to the response of WHEY when equal protein is provided in both treatments.

10 healthy subjects will be recruited and will receive both WPH and WHEY supplementation in a single blind crossover design. Muscle protein synthesis will be measured on both occasions.

Exercise could help to prevent these fractures by increasing bone strength and improving posture. Unfortunately, not all exercises strengthen bone. Exercises that do work (e.g. heavy weight lifting) are not popular with women at risk of osteoporosis. The investigators will develop a feasible exercise programme that can be done at a community centre or at home, using resistance bands. The investigators will involve women in designing the programme and incorporate strategies to support behaviour change. The investigators will then examine whether the programme improves bone density, posture or muscle strength in eighty women. Half the women, chosen at random, will take up exercise whilst the remaining half act as a control group. The investigators will take bone scans to determine bone density, and measure spinal curvature and strength, before and after the six- month programme. Findings will be useful in making recommendations as to which types of exercise increase spine bone density and will help to design future research on maximising vertebral strength.

NCT04255225,"['Breast Cancer', 'Cancer-related Problem/Condition', 'Cognitive Impairment', 'Physical Activity']",2016-09,2017-03,"Approximately 75% of cancer survivors experience some degree of cognitive deficit throughout their cancer experience, with upwards of one third of breast cancer survivors reporting impairments up to a decade after treatment. Chemotherapy and adjuvant therapy to remove cancerous tissue can result in deficits in attention, speed of processing, memory, and quality of life. Physical activity has been associated with a number of health benefits for breast cancer survivors including improvements in cognitive function. The investigators recently reported on the beneficial effects of acute exercise, or single sessions of physical activity, on processing speed and spatial working memory in breast cancer survivors, suggesting that acute bouts of physical activity may mitigate select domains of CRCI. Specifically, survivors in this study demonstrated faster processing speed, and trended towards faster and more accurate spatial working memory, after thirty minutes of moderate-intensity walking compared to seated rest. But half an hour of walking may be challenging to certain subgroups of survivors, particularly those who are deconditioned or with significant barriers to longer walks. With a renewed focus on un-bouted physical activity and avoiding inactivity during survivorship, it is important to better understand the dose or volume of exercise responsible for providing breast cancer survivors with the greatest cognitive benefits. The investigators examined the effects of varying durations of exercise (e.g., 10, 20 and 30 minutes) on cognitive function in breast cancer survivors to identify the optimal length of acute exercise. Findings from this study will inform new guidelines for acute exercise after cancer.",50,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A
