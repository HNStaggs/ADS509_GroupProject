NCT00039624,['Prostate Cancer'],,2004-07-29,"This study will evaluate the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for guiding placement of hollow needles into the prostate gland for delivering internal radiation therapy to patients with prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is often treated with a combination of external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy (internal radiation delivered close to the tumor). This study will determine whether MRI is more accurate in guiding needle placement than ultrasound, which is currently used for this purpose. Patients will have one brachytherapy treatment followed by 5 weeks of external beam treatments and a second brachytherapy.

Patients 18 years of age and older with prostate cancer that has not spread to the bone may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a physical examination, blood and urine tests, and a bone scan.

To plan for radiation therapy, patients will have standard computed tomography (CT) and MRI scans of the pelvis and prostate. In addition, CT and MRI scans will be done to determine if the prostate is in a good position for brachytherapy. For these scans, patients will have an enema and a tube will be placed in the rectum. They will then lie still on their side for about 45 minutes during the scan. Patients who have blood in their urine will also undergo cystoscopy. This is an examination of the bladder using a small camera that is advanced through the penis into the bladder.

Patients are given an antibiotic for 2 days before the brachytherapy and on the morning of the procedure. Before the test, they have a small enema and are given medicines through the vein and into the spine for relaxation and to decrease any discomfort. (The test is done under general anesthesia for patients who require it.) The patient is moved on a stretcher into the MRI scanner and a catheter is inserted into the bladder through the penis. The bladder is filled with water and a tube is placed in the rectum. With the help of a plastic guide placed against the skin, about 14 to 18 needles are then placed in the prostate. Some stitches are sewn to hold the needles and the guide in place, and the tube in the rectum is removed. The patient is the transferred from the MR scanner into the CT scanner, where the rectal tube is reinserted and the needles are adjusted. A cystoscopy is done to make sure the needles do not enter the bladder. When the needles are adjusted, the tube is removed from the rectum and the patient is moved to the radiation oncology clinic.

After a few hours, when the radiation dose has been calculated, a radioactive substance called iridium is administered. The needles placed in the prostate are connected to a radiation machine, and thin wires with radioactive material on the tips are inserted into each needle and withdrawn a little at a time. The process takes about 20 to 30 minutes. The patient is then disconnected from the machine and undergoes another MRI scan to confirm the position of the needles. The needles and catheter are then removed and the patient is monitored for a while before going home. Patients then have 5 weeks of external beam therapy, followed by a second brachytherapy treatment.

So far, the studies on muscle activation in fibromyalgia (mostly using surface electromyography) have shown some unusual functioning, a kind of overuse, but the results have been somewhat contradictory.

FM symptoms share some features with small fibre neuropathy, which is a disease or abnormality of small nerve fibres with a diverse aetiology. Recently, several research groups have shown (studying both the electrical function of superficial nerves and nerve endings of skin samples) that up to 50% of the FM patients with severe symptoms have small fibre neuropathy: their small nerves do not function properly and small nerve fibre density in their skin is reduced. However, as this phenomenon is common but not a rule, it might be rather a consequence of some underlying mechanisms of the syndrome, creating even more symptoms.

The aim is to investigate whether there would exist metabolic changes in FM patients that would create pain and lead to functional changes and damage in small nerve fibres. The investigators also aim to explore the muscle function particularly in distressed situations and at rest. The hypothesis is that a towards-overuse-altered function would create unfavourable metabolic changes. Third, the aim is to investigate some psychological factors (such as tendency to get anxious or distressed) to find out, if there is any association between them and muscle function.

The FM patients as well as healthy control subjects will be recruited at Helsinki University Hospital Pain Clinic and from primary care at Vantaa Health Care Centre. The voluntary test subjects will attend

1. A muscle function examination of 30 minutes with electromyography using surface electrodes, including mentally distressing tasks and relaxing periods.

NCT04435925,"['Breast Disease', 'Anesthesia', 'Inflammatory Response']",,2020-12-30,"Mastectomy triggers stress and inflammation responses due to tissue trauma. Surgical stress will increase levels of hormones (adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, antidiuretic hormone, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) and inflammatory cytokines (Tumor Necrotic Factor-α, interleukin-1, interleukin-2, and interleukin-6) in the body. This causes insulin resistance, gluconeogenesis, and glycolysis, and impaired insulin secretion, which results in hyperglycemia due to intraoperative stress. Intraoperative hyperglycemia increases postoperative complications and mortality. Inhibition of hyperglycemia due to operative stress and stress hormones with good anesthetic management in improving patient outcomes.

The choice of opioid type plays an important role in suppressing the perioperative stress and inflammatory response. Opioids are an alternative, besides the use of regional anesthetic techniques which have been proven to suppress the perioperative stress response. Fentanyl is one of the phenylpiperidine synthetic opioids. Large doses of fentanyl can reduce stress responses but also increase side effects, such as hemodynamic instability and decrease T-cell function.

Remifentanil provides unique pharmacokinetic benefits through nonspecific esterase enzyme metabolism, so it has a very fast onset and half-life. In addition, remifentanil also provides benefits in reducing the production of interleukin 6 cytokines (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and inhibits neutrophil migration through the endothelial layer.

The stress response to stress and inflammation is directly proportional to the dose of remifentanil given. It is reported that remifentanil can suppress cortisol response according to increasing dose.

The investigators' previous studies discovered that Artemisinin dramatically reduced serum androgen levels and improved poly-cystic ovary syndrome(PCOS) in animals. Preliminary study by the investigators found that artemisinin derivatives are capable of reducing both androgen levels and improving insulin resistance, two clinical characteristics of PCOS. Thus artemisinin derivatives has the potential effect to alleviate PCOS symptoms. The current study aims to investigate the effect of artemisinin on improving PCOS and serum androgen levels in PCOS subjects."

NCT00971958,"['HIV Infections', 'Circumcision']",2009-05-01,,"Background: Novel HIV prevention approaches are urgently needed in Botswana and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. Although adult male circumcision (MC) has been shown to reduce the heterosexual acquisition of HIV by men by about 60%, MC in infancy is optimal for its relative ease, lower cost and low rate of complications. We have conducted focus groups and semi-structured interviews that suggest neonatal MC (\< 28 days of life) would be an acceptable public HIV prevention strategy in Botswana. The government of Botswana is committed to scaling up MC services in the immediate future and they plan to include neonates. Understanding decision-making around infant MC will be essential to maximize the effectiveness of this HIV prevention strategy.

Specific Aims: The investigators propose to: 1) determine the acceptability and actual uptake of neonatal MC in southeastern Botswana and identify barriers to uptake; 2) ascertain the feasibility and safety of neonatal MC in Botswana; 3) Estimate what, if any, advantages would exist for scale up of Mogen Clamp, Plastibell or AccuCirc with regard to human resources, equipment needs, adverse events and acceptability to health-care providers and families in Botswana.

Study Design and Schema: The investigators will conduct structured interviews with early postpartum mothers and fathers to determine correlates of neonatal MC acceptability and uptake, defined as neonatal MC following informed consent. Male infants will be circumcised by a trained doctor in a hospital / clinic setting by one of three FDA-approved devices that are currently in use in US hospitals: Mogen clamp, Plastibell or AccuCirc. Circumcision with Mogen Clamp or Plastibell will be done before 29 days of life. Circumcision with AccuCirc will be done before 11 days of life (FDA approval limit for device). The investigators will also administer questionnaires to the parents at the regular pediatric follow-up visit(s) to assess impressions of / satisfaction with the infant's procedure outcome over time. Provider impressions of the three methods will also be evaluated. Sample size will be 150 infants per arm for a total of 450 infants males circumcised (and an estimated 800 parental questionnaires).

Public Health Significance: The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS state that countries with severe, generalized HIV epidemics but low rates of MC should offer this surgery as an important, evidence-based HIV prevention intervention, including among neonates. These two agencies also recommended that additional research on the most feasible, safe, and sustainable ways of scaling up MC intervention should be performed. This study will be in keeping with these recommendations.

Please note the Mogen clamp and Plastibell study arms began as a randomized trial before the initiation of the AccuCirc single-arm portion. Although the settings in which the three devices were studied were similar, the AccuCirc trial enrollment began at two sites (Gaborone and Molepolole) only after completion of the Mogen clamp and Plastibell arms, which was conducted in three sites (Gaborone, Molepolole and Mochudi).

NCT05324020,['Breast Cancer'],,2022-11-30,"Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors are two oral hormonal therapies (OHT) that decrease the risk of breast cancer recurrence by over 30 %. Their efficacy however strongly depends on the duration of use (5 to 10 years). Earlier work demonstrated that the longer an individual is not taking her OHT the less likely she is to restart her therapy.

Thus, identifying the moment of treatment interruption in real-time and being able to contact the patient at these specific time-points may be the key to effective health interventions by improving medication adherence to reduce BC recurrence - therefore, increasing overall Breast Cancer survival (BCS). EHealth technologies may be a very effective mean to identify these interruptions in a real-time manner and to provide support at the time the person needs it.

The overall aim of the E-dherence Pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of the E-Health intervention to enhance OHT adherence in BCS. Feasibility is defined based on 1.The eHealth intervention acceptability, 2. eHealth intervention quality and 3. medication adherence.

The study will include female breast cancer starting their first prescription of tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors and are outpatient and followed-up in either of the 2 study sites. Participants should be 18 years or older and be fluent in french and or German and possess a smart-phone (iOS, Android).

Within the E-dherence Pilot study each patient receives the eHealth intervention.

The eHealth intervention consists a Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS®) Helping Hand and MEMS Adherence Software application.

The eHealth intervention will support BCS to adhere to the recommended OHT (i) by alerting the participants to take their OHT, and (ii) by allowing patient-physician communication.

The intervention consists of a Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS®), an electronic pillbox that counts the OHT intake, the date and time. Through Near Field Communication (NFC) the device is connected to the MEMS Adherence Software application on the patients' phone (Android or iOS). At the beginning, each patient can personalize the application. This application registers the history of OHT adherence (time and date of medication intake) and sends reminders to the patient to take the treatment as scheduled.

Additionally, the patient receives an integrated calendar in the App that notifies the patient for upcoming medical visits. The eHealth intervention comprises a questionnaire that should be filled-out weekly and that informs about the presence and severity of side effects. These data are collected in real-time and monitored on a weekly basis by the clinical research nurse (CRN) in charge of the study. In case of an alert, meaning recurrent non-adherence and/or reporting of side-effects, the CRN will contact the breast cancer nurse (BCN) in charge of the patient.

This indicates that a neuro-vascular coupling between neural activity and blood flow exists as described previously for the brain.

However, it has been shown in an animal experiment, that an increase in blood flow, evoked by diffuse luminance flicker stimulation is paralleled by an decrease in pO2 in the tissue. Thus, in this study we set out to investigate the flicker light induced increase in blood flow under elevated blood pO2.

Group prenatal care models have been demonstrated through rigorous research to provide significantly improved birth outcomes with implications for maternal-child health and substantial cost savings. However, group prenatal care is currently available to only a small fraction of the more than four million women who give birth annually in the US. Through the development, implementation and evaluation of a new model of group prenatal care, we will create an outcomes-focused model of group prenatal care that will be scalable nationally with an eye toward improving US birth outcomes.

The long-term objective of the proposed study is to reduce the risk for adverse perinatal outcomes during and after pregnancy among women and families receiving prenatal care in health centers in 3 geographic locations serving vulnerable populations: Hidalgo County Texas, Nashville Tennessee, and Detroit Michigan. We will develop, disseminate, and evaluate a new and improved model of group prenatal care, ""Expect with Me,"" based on our previous research on group models of prenatal care, which has already yielded favorable behavioral and biological results in two randomized controlled trials.

NCT02311049,['Prostate Cancer'],,2020-06-14,"External beam radiotherapy (RT) is one of the standard curative treatment options for patients with prostate cancer (PC). Several randomised trials have shown excellent long-term biochemical outcome with higher radiation doses. Nowadays, RT for PC commonly consists of delivering 74-80 Gy in 2 Gy fractions, resulting in an overall treatment time of 7-8 weeks. The sensitivity of different tissues to fractionation changes can be quantified through the alpha/beta ratio in the linear-quadratic model. Dose-response analysis of PC patients treated with both external beam RT and brachytherapy has led to the hypothesis that the alpha/beta ratio of PC is lower than for most other tumors and approaches a value characteristic of late responding tissues. Values between 1.2 and 3.9 Gy have been calculated. If the alpha/beta ratio of PC is indeed low, then hypofractionating RT treatments can theoretically maintain high bioequivalent tumor doses, shorten overall treatment time and decrease late toxicities.The advantages in terms of patient convenience and treatment cost are obvious. There is level I evidence that shows that hypofractionated radiotherapy schedules have at least equivalent biochemical outcome with only a small increase in acute but not late toxicity when compared to conventional fractionation RT schedules.

Results on different hypofractionation schedules have been reported, however the optimal hypofractionation is not clear so far. In this randomised trial we would like to compare 2 different radiotherapyschedules: 16 fractions à rato of 4 fractions a week versus 25 fractions à rato of 5 fractions a week.

Endometriosis is a condition in which the lining of the uterus (endometrium) is found outside of the uterus. The diagnosis of endometriosis is usually made at surgery.

Medical therapies that act to decrease the level of estrogen can reduce the amount of endometriosis and pain. When therapies are discontinued, symptoms often return. In addition, medical treatment for endometriosis is expensive and is often associated with weak bones (osteoporosis) and hot flashes as a result of low levels of estrogen.

Surgical treatment is removal or destruction of the endometriosis tissue. Studies show the pain from endometriosis is relieved longer with tissue removal than with destruction.

NCT02188459,"['Smoking', 'Nicotine Dependence']",,2020-01-22,"Smoking during pregnancy adversely affects the health of the mother and her developing baby. Maternal smoking approximately doubles the risk of miscarriage, placental complications, preterm delivery, low birth weight and fetal and newborn death. The most common adverse effect of smoking during pregnancy is low birth weight, which sharply increases the risk of the newborn becoming ill or dying. In the US, maternal smoking is responsible for 30% of low birth weight babies, 10% of premature deliveries, and 5% of infant deaths. Fortunately, smoking cessation by pregnancy week 16, or as late as the third trimester, results in a near-normal weight infant at birth. Even reductions in smoking increase birth weight.

Despite the known risks, the majority of women who are smoking at the time of their first prenatal visit continue to smoke. Bupropion is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for smoking cessation in people who are not pregnant, but there are no carefully controlled studies on the use of Bupropion to help pregnant women quit smoking. Bupropion is also FDA approved to treat depression, and some pregnant women have taken it for that purpose, even though it has not been formally tested. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized, parallel-group, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 10 week trial of Bupropion in 360 pregnant women who smoke daily and wish to quit smoking.

The study has three primary hypotheses. First, the investigators hypothesize that Bupropion treated subjects will decrease the frequency of smoking more than placebo-treated subjects. Second the investigators hypothesize that Bupropion treated subjects will have greater positive pregnancy and child health outcomes than placebo-treated subjects. Third the investigators hypothesize that Bupropion treated subjects will have decreased frequency of depressive symptoms and cigarette craving than placebo-treated subjects.

Maternal smoking approximately doubles the risk of miscarriage, placental complications, preterm delivery, low birth weight and fetal and newborn death. The most common adverse effect of smoking during pregnancy is low birth weight, which sharply increases the risk of the newborn becoming ill or dying. In the US, maternal smoking is responsible for 30% of low birth weight babies, 10% of premature deliveries, and 5% of infant deaths. Fortunately, smoking cessation by pregnancy week 16, or as late as the third trimester, results in a near-normal weight infant at birth. Even reductions in smoking increase birth weight.

Despite the known risks, the majority of women who are smoking at the time of their first prenatal visit continue to smoke. Bupropion is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for smoking cessation in people who are not pregnant, but there are no carefully controlled studies on the use of Bupropion to help pregnant women quit smoking. Bupropion is also FDA approved to treat depression, and some pregnant women have taken it for that purpose, even though it has not been formally tested. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized, parallel-group, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 10 week trial of Bupropion in 360 pregnant women who smoke daily and wish to quit smoking.

The study has three primary hypotheses. First, the investigators hypothesize that Bupropion treated subjects will decrease the frequency of smoking more than placebo-treated subjects. Second the investigators hypothesize that Bupropion treated subjects will have greater positive pregnancy and child health outcomes than placebo-treated subjects. Third the investigators hypothesize that Bupropion treated subjects will have decreased frequency of depressive symptoms and cigarette craving than placebo-treated subjects. These finding will provide information on the safety and efficacy of bupropion treat for smoking cessation in pregnant women."

Its diagnostic is based on clinical examination with a positive predictive value of about 40 %. The role of the Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in delivery has been suggested by its secretion in the amniotic fluid during labour and by the increase in the expression of its RNA messengers in the peripheral maternal blood. We have also shown that the proportion of MCP-1-expressing monocytes is higher in women with vaginal delivery compared with those with caesarean delivery prior the onset of labour.

OBJECTIVES : Primary To seek link between the respective proportions of circulating maternal monocyte and lymphocyte subpopulations and the true onset of PTL characterised by delivery occurring within 7 days post admission. Secondary: to (1) compare the predictive values of these new markers with those currently used, e.g. quantification of fœtal fibronectin and assessment of cervical length and effacement, (2) Compare the respective proportions of monocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations in maternal blood and fœtal membranes, (3) determine if a correlation exists between the activation markers expressed by maternal monocyte and lymphocyte subpopulations and the neonatal outcomes of preterm infants.

Modifying the dietary habits during adolescent girls may be a sustainable approach to ensure good nutritional status among population because those habits tend to stay for a life time. Over many years, there has much effort to overcome anemia. Iron supplementation and fortification have been the most popular and convenient strategies to combat anemia. However, there has not much success due to the high still prevalence of anemia among children and women reproductive age. Food-based approach has been defined as one of the most effective programs to combat or reduce the prevalence of anemia. In the meantime, food based recommendations (FBR) formulation through linear programming (LP) approach has been found to be more effective than the traditional method of developing FBRs called ""trial and error"". LP approach allows us to develop optimized diet for target population with addition to detect the nutrient problem in specific region. This study therefore aims to identify the nutrient problems in the community, to develop optimized FBR employing the LP approach and to assess effect of nutrition education using optimized FBR in order to improve the nutritional and hemoglobin status among adolescent schoolgirls in rural Malang City.

Several techniques have been studied in order to decrease the high false positive rate. Fetal ST waveform analysis (STAN) has been studied combined with CTG. A recent meta-analysis of randomized trials, however, showed that STAN during labor did not improve perinatal outcomes or decrease operative delivery rates, except for a 9% decrease in operative vaginal delivery.Comparisons of visual and computerized interpretation of EFM have also been reported. However, whether or fetal monitoring with computer analysis improve perinatal outcomes is still subject of debate.

Thus, we aim to evaluate whether intrapartum fetal monitoring with computer analysis increase the incidence of obstetric intervention when compared with visual analysis through a single-center randomized controlled trial."

It is licensed for use to achieve effects of coagulation and ablation. It is similar to conventional surgical devices that are routinely used (called diathermy) to achieve these effects. The PJ however is slightly different in that it may also be used on tissue to vaporise tumour nodules in women with ovarian cancer during surgery though the full extent of this role remains unclear."

The study of certain adipokines such as adiponectin has demonstrated an inverse association with insulin resistance, especially in Latin population lower levels of adiponectin have been observed compared to other ethnic groups. It appears to be an important molecule that is involved in limiting the pathogenesis of obesity-linked disorders and may have potential benefits as a marker to evaluate the effect of possible interventions on the MetS components and its complications.

Metformin is treatment of choice in patients with MetS, due to its low cost and pharmacological comparable effects with thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone), it decreases hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, free fatty acids and triglycerides, it produces as well, a moderate weight loss, improves lipid profile and delays the appearance of diabetes mellitus in subjects with an abnormal fasting glucose.

A second choice to lower the risks would be the addition of a fiber like inulin, a prebiotic, since it has demonstrated metabolic benefits on lipid and carbohydrates metabolism by several mechanisms proposed such as induction of lipogenic enzymes by glucose, production of short-chained fatty acids, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and growth of Bifidobacterium.

In theory, Elidel should also treat LS without the serious side effects that accompany corticosteroids. Therefore, this study is designed to compare the effectiveness and safety of a topical corticosteroid (clobetasol) versus Elidel 1% cream for the treatment of LS."

NCT03500016,"['Type2 Diabetes', 'Insulin Resistance']",,2021-11-12,"Type 2 diabetes are characterized by insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Insulin resistance plays a major role for the increased risk of heart disease seen in type 2 diabetes. No specific treatment of insulin resistance is currently available, except from increased physical activity and weight-loss.

Insulin resistance is characterized by abnormalities in the use of glucose and fat in the muscle, and is associated with abnormal function and content of mitochondria (the power houses of our cells) as well as increased levels of fat within the muscle.

The investigators believe that abnormalities in the use of glucose and fat in muscle cells in response to insulin and exercise can explain why insulin resistance is associated with abnormal function and content of mitochondria and an increased amount of fat in skeletal muscle of patients with type 2 diabetes and individuals with obesity.

The major purpose of our project is, therefore, to investigate the effect of insulin in physiological concentrations and the effect of both acute exercise and 8 weeks of high intensity interval exercise-training on

2. insulin signaling, mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy in skeletal muscle

4) regulators of storage of fat into lipid droplets and their interaction with mitochondria in skeletal muscle 5) acetylation and phosphorylation of enzymes (proteins) in major metabolic and signaling pathways, as well as 6) transcriptional and signalling networks regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and substrate metabolism.

Skeletal muscle and fat tissue samples obtained under these conditions will be used for assessment of tissue-levels of specific sets of genes and enzymes known to be involved in insulin action, quality and size of mitochondria, and storage of fat into lipid droplets and their interaction with mitochondria.

This project is expected to provide important and novel insight into the causal relationship between insulin resistance, accumulation of fat and abnormal content and function of mitochondria in skeletal muscle in type 2 diabetes.

It is linked to a repeated collapse of the upper airways during sleep.

Episodes of apnea and hypopnea cause hypoxemia and micro-awakenings with a well-established impact on quality of life and daily activities. Physiologically, OSAHS can be aggravated when moving from a standing to a supine position through fluid shift from the lower limbs to the upper body, thereby modifying the opening of the upper airways. A decrease of the water balance by bilateral diurnal compression of the lower limbs (during daytime in standing position) may limit this nocturnal fluid shift (at night in supine position) and thus reduce the severity of OSAHS.

Two comparative clinical trials \[Redolfi 2011; White 2015\] have shown a clinically modest reduction of sleep apnea (-36% and -27%, respectively), which was however statistically significant versus untreated control group (p = 0.002 and p = 0.04, respectively), when elastic compression medical devices of 20 to 30 mmHg were worn during the daytime.

In an effort to reduce the transmission of GTIs, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a syndromic diagnostic approach as a low cost alternative in places with no access to laboratory diagnostic tests.

Justification. In patients with syndrome of vaginal discharge, an effective treatment against Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis, and bacterial vaginosis is adviced, therefore, for syndromic management of symptomatic vaginal discharge the combination of fluconazole and secnidazole could be used. No studies evaluating this combination were found in the literature reviewed.

Objectives: To describe the safety and the clinical and microbiological efficacy of a single oral dose of a combined treatment with secnidazole + fluconazole for the syndromic management of symptomatic vaginal discharge.

Methods: Design: open label, uncontrolled clinical trial to estimate clinical efficacy and safety of the combination of fluconazole and secnidazole for the treatment of symptomatic vaginal discharge. The participants will be sexually active women with lower genital tract symptoms (leukorrhea, itching, burning, pain, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, or urethral symptoms) compatible with symptomatic vaginal discharge syndrome. The study will be conducted in an outpatient service of a hospital in Bogota, Colombia. Given the descriptive character of the study, no a priori hypothesis is considered.

NCT02435563,['Healthy'],2014-08-01,,"Ticagrelor is a new generation antiplatelet agent with higher efficacy as compared to clopidogrel and prasugrel in treatment of patients with moderate and high ischemic risks. Ticagrelor is active as such and its hepatic metabolism by CYP3A generates also an active metabolite. Because of the remarkable progress in HIV therapies the number of older age patients is on the rise, requiring adequate cardiovascular treatment. Since frontline HIV therapies include ritonavir, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A enzyme, ticagrelor is contraindicated in these patients because of the expected interaction and bleeding risk. A lower efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel, which are both pro-drugs, in the presence of ritonavir has been already demonstrated. Therefore, administration of a lower dose of ticagrelor may be a good alternative in HIV patients in order to lessen the impact of this pharmacokinetic interaction. The aim of this study is to adjust the dose of ticagrelor in case of co-treatment with ritonavir to achieve the same pharmacokinetic profile as administered alone using a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model.

As the first step, a pharmacokinetic (PK) model for ticagrelor and its active metabolite will be created based on available in vitro and in vivo parameters in healthy volunteers.

An open-label, 2 sessions cross over study will be conducted with 20 healthy male volunteers at Clinical Research Center (CRC) of Geneva University Hospitals (HUG). During the first session of the clinical trial, a single dose 180 mg ticagrelor will be administered to the volunteers and obtained pharmacokinetic data will be fitted into the model for optimization. Thereafter a simulated trial by the Simcyp® simulator in presence of a single dose 100 mg ritonavir will allow evaluating the impact of CYP3A inhibition on the concentration-time profile of ticagrelor and its active metabolite. The necessary dose of ticagrelor to minimize the magnitude of this interaction will be calculated. This new dose will be co-administered with ritonavir in the same volunteers during the second session of the clinical trial. The purpose is to obtain the same PK profile with single dose of 180 mg ticagrelor administered alone and with an adapted dose of ticagrelor co-administered with a single dose 100 mg ritonavir. Moreover, the pharmacodynamic effect of ticagrelor will be measured in both sessions of the clinical trial using two specific platelet function tests: the VAsodilator-Stimulated Phosphoprotein assay (VASP) and VerifyNow® P2Y12. With the same PK profile, the same pharmacodynamic activity is expected. The modulation of activity of CYP3A and P-gp by ritonavir will be also monitored using micro dose midazolam and fexofenadine as probe substrates.

The purpose of this study is to use the Simcyp® Simulator mechanistic PBPK modeling to broaden the application field of ticagrelor, especially in HIV patients.

The leading reasons why women refuse or discontinue HRT are fear of malignancy, side effects such as vaginal bleeding, weight gain, depressed mood, and breast tenderness, and social reasons such as regarding menopause as a natural transition, not as a disease that requires treatment. Millions of women expressed their concern on the safety of hormone replacement therapy since the data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study was released, which reported an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, stroke and thromboembolic disease with conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate compared with placebo (2). The study has also demonstrated that quality of life (3) and cognition (4) were no better in the HRT group than the placebo group. In view of these problems, women are increasingly turning to alternative therapies in an effort to manage their menopausal symptoms (1).

Menopause is associated with decreasing sex steroid levels. The effect of menopause on circulating androgen levels has been studied by several investigators with variable findings. The levels of testosterone and androstenedione appear to show a small but significant decrease just before or within the first 2 years after menopause, with a decrease in testosterone amounting to approximately 15% (5,6). Unlike the abrupt decrease in estradiol levels associated with menopause, circulating testosterone, DHEA, and DHEAS levels decrease more gradually, beginning in the years before menopause and continuing thereafter (6,7). As a consequence, some women may experience symptoms of androgen decrease in the period before cessation of menses. By giving Tualang Honey to these postmenopausal women, it is postulated that the symptoms of androgen deficiency or menopausal symptoms should be reduced.

It has been demonstrated that diet can alter the characteristics and function of many membranes in the body, which has an effect on cardiovascular and metabolic health.

There are two fatty acids that are of particular interest to researchers, eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA). These fatty acids have unique unsaturated structures, and their incorporation into biological membranes seems to generate important and positive physiological effects. The body is unable to synthesize these fatty acids in high concentrations to elicit significant effects, so they must be obtained through diet in food or via supplementation.

The development of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) allows for shaping of radiotherapy fields to reduce the doses delivered to organs at risk (OARs). This does appear to reduce the risk of long and short term toxicity (although there is little randomized evidence). However pelvic organ position varies both between and even during radiotherapy fractions; this means that radiotherapy margins must be generous to allow adequate coverage of the clinical target volume (CTV) but this also increases dose to OARs.

There have been a number of studies evaluating pelvic organ motion in cervical cancer as well as assessing different adaptive radiotherapy strategies.

This treatment is associated with long term side effects in around half of patients with up to 10% suffering from grade 3-4 toxicity.

The development of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) allows for shaping of radiotherapy fields to reduce the doses delivered to organs at risk (OARs). This does appear to reduce the risk of long and short term toxicity (although there is little randomized evidence). However pelvic organ position varies both between and even during radiotherapy fractions; this means that radiotherapy margins must be generous to allow adequate coverage of the clinical target volume (CTV) but this also increases dose to OARs.

There have been a number of studies evaluating pelvic organ motion in cervical cancer as well as assessing different adaptive radiotherapy strategies. These have included individualized margins, plan of the day and adaptive techniques. Most of these studies have been carried out using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging which is often poor quality with limited soft tissue contrast.

NCT01858441,['Pharmacogenetic Study'],2013-04-01,2020-09-06,"Prostate cancer is the 2nd leading cause of mortality in men in developed countries. For metastatic prostate cancer patients, the 1st-line treatment relies on hormone therapy. However, the efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy remains limited in time and most patients eventually develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), while remaining androgen-dependent.

Docetaxel is currently the standard of care for metastatic CPRC. It has been shown that testosterone levels within metastatic tumoral tissue from men receiving hormone therapy were significantly higher than those from primitive tumors of untreated prostate cancers. Among the mechanistic explanations for this observation, it has been shown that CYP17A1, a key enzyme in de novo steroid synthesis localized in testis and adrenal gland, is up-regulated in CRPC metastases. The existence of de novo CYP17A1-dependent androgen biosynthesis at the tumor level has supported the development of novel antiandrogens, including abiraterone acetate (AA), an irreversible CYP17A1 inhibitor. Based on a placebo-controlled phase III trial, demonstrating that abiraterone prolonged overall survival (14.8 vs 10.9 months) and increased PSA response rate (29% vs 6%) in patients with metastatic CRPC who previously received docetaxel, AA was recently approved by the FDA and French Health Authorities. AA is well-tolerated and main toxicities are urinary tract infections (2%) and a syndrome of secondary mineralocorticoid excess characterized by fluid overload, hypertension and hypokaliema (1% to 4% of grade 3-4).

Almost concomitantly, a novel taxane-class cytotoxic agent, cabazitaxel, has proven efficacy in CRPC treatment after failure to docetaxel, and has recently been approved by the FDA and French Health Authority. Although cabazitaxel exhibits a less favorable toxicity profile, this precise context creates a need to dispose of objective individual criteria so as to orientate patients to treatment towards AA or towards cabazitaxel. To this purpose, several approaches are of potential interest for identifying good candidates for a treatment by AA: tumor-specific TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion measurement, circulating tumor cell analysis, tumoral CYP17A1 expression, analysis of splicing forms of the androgen receptor. However, the clinical relevance of these potential predictive factors remains to be established in this setting.

Pharmacogenetics examines germinal gene polymorphisms likely to influence the pharmacodynamics of anticancer agents. Encouraging results have recently been reported by our group for irinotecan pharmacogenetics with concrete possibilities of individual dose adaptations, and very recently by other investigators for sunitinib pharmacogenetics. Concerning AA, one can hypothesize that tumors with elevated CYP17A1 expression will be more likely to respond better to AA. This hypothesis is indirectly supported by the observation that in CPRC patients receiving AA, PSA-based response is higher in patients with elevated pre-treatment blood concentration of DHEA and androstenedione.

The CYP17A1 gene presents numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), whose frequencies of rare alleles are at least 12%. Their functional impact has been suggested for nine of them, which were linked either to the risk of developing prostate cancer or to survival of prostate cancer patients. So far, no study has examined the links between these polymorphisms and the efficacy of a CYP17A1 inhibitor. Also, relationships with the efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy have recently been reported for SNPs of genes involved in the membrane-transport testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone, namely SLCO2B1 and SLCO1B3. One can make the hypothesis that gene polymorphisms of these transporters may play a role for the intratumoral concentration of testosterone locally-produced through the mediation of CYP17A1 activity.

To resume, two second-line treatments of metastatic CRPC cancers are currently available, thus is raising the question in practice of which treatment is more appropriate for a given patient. Herein, the present study proposes an original pharmacogenetic approach in order to highlight a relationship between AA activity and patient's genetic profile. Ultimately, this could reveal evidences of genetic predispositions for potentially good responders to AA treatment.",148.0,18 Years,90 Years,18.0,90.0,2013.0,4.0,2010.0,1,2715.0,7.44,"['Pharmacogenetic Study'] Prostate cancer is the 2nd leading cause of mortality in men in developed countries. For metastatic prostate cancer patients, the 1st-line treatment relies on hormone therapy. However, the efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy remains limited in time and most patients eventually develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), while remaining androgen-dependent.

Docetaxel is currently the standard of care for metastatic CPRC. It has been shown that testosterone levels within metastatic tumoral tissue from men receiving hormone therapy were significantly higher than those from primitive tumors of untreated prostate cancers. Among the mechanistic explanations for this observation, it has been shown that CYP17A1, a key enzyme in de novo steroid synthesis localized in testis and adrenal gland, is up-regulated in CRPC metastases. The existence of de novo CYP17A1-dependent androgen biosynthesis at the tumor level has supported the development of novel antiandrogens, including abiraterone acetate (AA), an irreversible CYP17A1 inhibitor. Based on a placebo-controlled phase III trial, demonstrating that abiraterone prolonged overall survival (14.8 vs 10.9 months) and increased PSA response rate (29% vs 6%) in patients with metastatic CRPC who previously received docetaxel, AA was recently approved by the FDA and French Health Authorities. AA is well-tolerated and main toxicities are urinary tract infections (2%) and a syndrome of secondary mineralocorticoid excess characterized by fluid overload, hypertension and hypokaliema (1% to 4% of grade 3-4).

Almost concomitantly, a novel taxane-class cytotoxic agent, cabazitaxel, has proven efficacy in CRPC treatment after failure to docetaxel, and has recently been approved by the FDA and French Health Authority. Although cabazitaxel exhibits a less favorable toxicity profile, this precise context creates a need to dispose of objective individual criteria so as to orientate patients to treatment towards AA or towards cabazitaxel. To this purpose, several approaches are of potential interest for identifying good candidates for a treatment by AA: tumor-specific TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion measurement, circulating tumor cell analysis, tumoral CYP17A1 expression, analysis of splicing forms of the androgen receptor. However, the clinical relevance of these potential predictive factors remains to be established in this setting.

Pharmacogenetics examines germinal gene polymorphisms likely to influence the pharmacodynamics of anticancer agents. Encouraging results have recently been reported by our group for irinotecan pharmacogenetics with concrete possibilities of individual dose adaptations, and very recently by other investigators for sunitinib pharmacogenetics. Concerning AA, one can hypothesize that tumors with elevated CYP17A1 expression will be more likely to respond better to AA. This hypothesis is indirectly supported by the observation that in CPRC patients receiving AA, PSA-based response is higher in patients with elevated pre-treatment blood concentration of DHEA and androstenedione.

The CYP17A1 gene presents numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), whose frequencies of rare alleles are at least 12%. Their functional impact has been suggested for nine of them, which were linked either to the risk of developing prostate cancer or to survival of prostate cancer patients. So far, no study has examined the links between these polymorphisms and the efficacy of a CYP17A1 inhibitor. Also, relationships with the efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy have recently been reported for SNPs of genes involved in the membrane-transport testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone, namely SLCO2B1 and SLCO1B3. One can make the hypothesis that gene polymorphisms of these transporters may play a role for the intratumoral concentration of testosterone locally-produced through the mediation of CYP17A1 activity.

To resume, two second-line treatments of metastatic CRPC cancers are currently available, thus is raising the question in practice of which treatment is more appropriate for a given patient. Herein, the present study proposes an original pharmacogenetic approach in order to highlight a relationship between AA activity and patient's genetic profile. Ultimately, this could reveal evidences of genetic predispositions for potentially good responders to AA treatment."

BAT has the unique capability to burn large amounts of sugar and fat and effectively dissipate this energy as heat due to the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) which is controlled by a thermogenic gene program of transcription factors, co-activators and protein kinases. Thus, enhancing the thermogenic gene program may be beneficial for treating obesity and T2D. Despite the importance of BAT in regulating metabolism our understanding of the factors which suppress its metabolic activity with obesity, aging and T2D are largely unknown. Recently, it was shown that peripheral serotonin, which is regulated by the tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1), is a negative regulator of BAT metabolic activity. In addition to serotonin, other studies have indicated that pro-inflammatory stimuli may also inhibit BAT metabolic activity. These data suggest that reduced activation of BAT may be due to increases in peripheral serotonin and inflammation. Importantly, the gut microbiome has recently been recognized as an important regulator of serotonin and inflammatory pathways suggesting the observed effects of the microbiome on obesity, T2D may be mediated in part through reductions in BAT activity.

One mechanism by which the environment may impact BAT activity and the thermogenic gene program over the last 3 decades involves changes in our food supply as result of changes in agricultural production (chlorpyrifos, glyphosphate) and the addition of food additives (fructose). These agents have been reported to alter inflammation, serotonin metabolism and the gut microbiome indicating a potential bimodal (direct and indirect via the microbiome) mechanism by which they may alter the thermogenic gene program and contribute to chronic metabolic disease.

NCT04689217,"['Pain, Acute']",,2021-04-25,"In case of cesarean section (CS) delivery, spinal anesthesia is the best anesthetic choice. It is simple to perform with rapid onset of anesthesia and lower incidence of failed block. Spinal anesthesia avoids the risk of aspiration, the neonatal depressant effect that may occur with general anesthesia (GA), and provides postoperative analgesia, however, spinal anesthesia has a lesser control on the level of blockade, may give insufficient visceral pain block and may be associated with nausea and vomiting especially during peritoneal traction, closure and uterine manipulation, exteriorization and rotation. A previous study reported nausea and vomiting in up to 70.5% patients in the spinal group while the incidence of moderate to severe pain was more frequent in exteriorized uterus patients.

Increasing the dosage of intrathecal local anesthetic may contribute to a decrease in the occurrence of intraoperative visceral pain, but at the cost of the risk and adverse effects of greater blockade.A variety of adjuvants have been used to prevent these disadvantages. The commonly used adjuvants include opioids; α2 stimulants such as clonidine and dexmedetomidine; NMDA receptor antagonist such as ketamine; GABA receptor agonists such as midazolam.

The added intrathecal opioids as fentanyl and nalbuphine to local anesthetics give a sufficient intraoperative visceral analgesia when they were used in C.S., with less sympathetic block and hemodynamic effect, and reduces the need for intraoperative analgesics with prolongation of postoperative analgesia.

Nalbuphine, a mixed agonist-antagonist opioid, has a potential to attenuate the mu-opioid effects and to enhance the kappa-opioid effects. It was synthesized attempting to produce analgesia without the undesirable side effects of mu agonist. Also, its combination with mu agonist opioids was tried by many researchers to decrease the incidence and severity of the common mu agonist side effects (respiratory depression, undesirable sedation, pruritus, bradycardia, nausea, vomiting and urinary retention), plus it can antagonize spinal induced shivering. Meanwhile, the benefits of both kappa and mu analgesia can be obtained.

Few studies compared the effects of intrathecal nalbuphine (opioid agonist-antagonist) and fentanyl (opioid agonist) as adjuvants to bupivacaine in spinal blocked for CS with variable results. However, they didn't compare their ability to control the visceral pain aggravated by uterine exteriorization in cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. This study will try to answer the question is nalbuphine effective enough in such scenario to be used routinely as a safer alternative to fentanyl, which is the opioid in common practice added to bupivacaine?

Aim of the study:

To compare the ability of the used doses in the study of intrathecal nalbuphine and intrathecal fentanyl to control the visceral pain aggravated by uterine exteriorization in cesarean section under spinal anesthesia

Objectives:

* To evaluate the visual analog scale (VAS) for visceral abdominal and shoulder pain every 5 minutes and the maximum score will be recorded for 30 minutes from the time of baby delivery.

A previous study reported nausea and vomiting in up to 70.5% patients in the spinal group while the incidence of moderate to severe pain was more frequent in exteriorized uterus patients.

Increasing the dosage of intrathecal local anesthetic may contribute to a decrease in the occurrence of intraoperative visceral pain, but at the cost of the risk and adverse effects of greater blockade.A variety of adjuvants have been used to prevent these disadvantages. The commonly used adjuvants include opioids; α2 stimulants such as clonidine and dexmedetomidine; NMDA receptor antagonist such as ketamine; GABA receptor agonists such as midazolam.

The added intrathecal opioids as fentanyl and nalbuphine to local anesthetics give a sufficient intraoperative visceral analgesia when they were used in C.S., with less sympathetic block and hemodynamic effect, and reduces the need for intraoperative analgesics with prolongation of postoperative analgesia.

Nalbuphine, a mixed agonist-antagonist opioid, has a potential to attenuate the mu-opioid effects and to enhance the kappa-opioid effects. It was synthesized attempting to produce analgesia without the undesirable side effects of mu agonist. Also, its combination with mu agonist opioids was tried by many researchers to decrease the incidence and severity of the common mu agonist side effects (respiratory depression, undesirable sedation, pruritus, bradycardia, nausea, vomiting and urinary retention), plus it can antagonize spinal induced shivering. Meanwhile, the benefits of both kappa and mu analgesia can be obtained.

Few studies compared the effects of intrathecal nalbuphine (opioid agonist-antagonist) and fentanyl (opioid agonist) as adjuvants to bupivacaine in spinal blocked for CS with variable results. However, they didn't compare their ability to control the visceral pain aggravated by uterine exteriorization in cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. This study will try to answer the question is nalbuphine effective enough in such scenario to be used routinely as a safer alternative to fentanyl, which is the opioid in common practice added to bupivacaine?

Aim of the study:

To compare the ability of the used doses in the study of intrathecal nalbuphine and intrathecal fentanyl to control the visceral pain aggravated by uterine exteriorization in cesarean section under spinal anesthesia

Objectives:

* To evaluate the visual analog scale (VAS) for visceral abdominal and shoulder pain every 5 minutes and the maximum score will be recorded for 30 minutes from the time of baby delivery.

NCT01535976,['Hypoventilation'],2011-08-01,,"Procedures performed under sedation have the same severity in regards to morbidity and mortality as procedures performed under general anesthesia1. The demand for anesthesia care outside the operating room has increased tremendously and it poses, according to a closed claim analysis, major risks to patients . Both closed claim analysis identified respiratory depression due to oversedation as the main risk to patients undergoing procedures under sedation. The major problem is that hypoventilation is only detected at very late stages in patients receiving supplemental oxygen. Besides the respiratory effects of hypoventilation, hypercapnia can also lead to hypertension, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias and seizures.

The incidence of anesthetized patients with obstructive sleep apnea has increased substantially over the last years along with the current national obesity epidemic. These patients are at increased risk of hypoventilation when exposed to anesthetic drugs. The context of the massive increase in procedural sedation and the extremely high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea poses major respiratory risks to patients and it may, in a near future, increase malpractice claims to anesthesiologists. The development of safer anesthesia regimen for sedation are, therefore, needed. The establishment of safer anesthetics regimen for sedation is in direct relationship with the anesthesia patient safety foundation priorities. It addresses peri-anesthetic safety problems for healthy patient's. It can also be broadly applicable and easily implemented into daily clinical care.

Ketamine has an established effect on analgesia but the effects of ketamine on ventilation have not been clearly defined. The lack of validated and sensitive instruments to evaluate the effects of ketamine on ventilation is an important reason for the conflicting results.The investigators have demonstrated that the transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitor is accurate in detecting hypoventilation in patients undergoing deep sedation. Animal data suggest that when added to propofol in a sedation regimen, ketamine decreased hypoventilation when compared to propofol alone. It is unknown if ketamine added to a commonly used sedative agent (propofol) can decrease the incidence and severity of hypoventilation in patients undergoing deep sedation. It is also unknown if the effect of ketamine on ventilation are different in patients with and without obstructive sleep apnea.

The investigators hypothesized that patients receiving ketamine and propofol will develop less intraoperative hypoventilation than patients receiving propofol alone. The investigators also hypothesized that this effect will be even greater in patients with obstructive sleep apnea than patients without obstructive sleep apnea.

Significance: Respiratory depression due to oversedation was identified twice as the major factor responsible for claims related to anesthesia. The high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea combined with more complex procedures done in outpatient settings can increase physical risks to patients and liability cases to anesthesiologists. The main goal of this project is to establish the effect of ketamine in preventing respiratory depression to patients undergoing procedures under sedation. If the investigators confirm the their hypothesis , their findings can be valuable not only to anesthesiologist but also to other specialties ( Emergency medicine, gastroenterologists, cardiologists, radiologists) that frequently performed procedural sedation.

Participants will complete a monthly baseline measure after they stop menstruating followed by taking CBD twice daily (BID) for five days for three menstrual cycles and complete the same measures. Researchers will compare 160mg of daily CBD isolate to 320mg of CBD isolate to see if there are differential effects on menstrual-related symptoms (MRS)."

NCT01888419,['Chronic Pain'],2014-10-01,,"Background

In Denmark, breast cancer is the most common fatal cancer in women with more than 4700 new cases annually. Unfortunately, up to 60% of women who are treated surgically for breast cancer, will experience chronic pain as a consequence of the treatment. This state of chronic neuropathic pain is termed ""Post Breast Therapy Pain Syndrome"" or PBTPS.

The purpose of the study

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether transplantation of fat cells (lipotransplantation) to the pain affected mastectomy area, could have an analgesic effect in women who have developed PBTPS. Secondary, we wish to investigate if lipotransplantation has a beneficial effect on the quality of the skin and the scar in the area where the transplanted fat cells are placed.

Hypotheses

* Lipotransplantation to the area under the scar tissue and the area under the pain-afflicted area reduces the pain in women with PBTPS.
* The neuropathic pain in PBTPS is correlated to the number of free nerve endings crossing the border between the dermis and the epidermis
* Lipotransplantation have a beneficial effect on the scar tissue structure and improves the skin quality.

Patients

Women who have undergone treatment for breast cancer and subsequently developed PBTPS. A total of 32 patients with PBTPS will be included.

Methods

Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either lipotransplantation or no active treatment. At three follow-up visits, the perceived pain of the patient and the skin and scar quality will be scored. In addition, a 3-mm biopsy will be taken from the skin on both the missing and the healthy breast, and from the mastectomy scar.

The scoring of the perceived pain and the quality of the skin and the scar, allows us to investigate if the lipotransplantation have an effect on pain, and skin/scar quality. Additionally, the skin and scar biopsies will be examined on a microscopic level, in order to investigate why lipotransplantation has these effects.

Conclusion

Also referred to as a posterior transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block, the QLB consists in deposition of local anesthetic on either the posterior or the anterolateral border of the quadratus lumborum muscle. TAP blocks have already been proved effective in urologic, abdominal, and gynecologic procedures by blocking the sensory nerve supply to the anterior abdominal wall thus reducing the amount of postoperative analgesic medication. The main advantages of QLB compared to the TAP block is a wider sensory block area and a longer duration of analgesia. This is due to the extension of local anesthetic agents beyond the TAP plane to the thoracic paravertebral space(4).

Previous reports have shown that QLB is effective in providing pain relief after various abdominal operations. However, there are no published reports on QLB for postoperative pain after abdominoplasty.

Management involves a multidisciplinary approach, through physicians, psychologists, sex therapists and physiotherapists. Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) is a therapeutic modality involving irradiation of injured or diseased tissue with a combination of red and infrared light. This process is thought to initiate a series of physiological reactions within the cells exposed to light at these wavelengths, leading to the restoration of normal cell structure and function. The investigators hypothesize that LLLT will be effective at reducing pain and improving sexual function among women with PVD.

The purpose of this double-blind randomized controlled trial is to assess the feasibility of using a LLLT intervention for the management of PVD in women. The aim is to determine whether there is evidence of a positive effect of LLLT, delivered using a BioFlexTM laser system (Health Canada Licence No. 7931) and a semi-standardized protocol, in terms of self-reported pain and sexual functioning, physiological responses to pressure applied at the vulvar vestibule, tonic and phasic activation of the PFM and/or corticomotor excitability to the PFMs in women with PVD with or without concurrent vaginismus (VAG) when compared to an identical treatment schedule where sham LLLT is delivered.

NCT02794324,['Breast Cancer'],2012-02-01,,"Radiotherapy (RT) has a major curative role in women with early breast cancer, and is recommended routinely after lumpectomy and selectively after mastectomy. It has contributed to a halving of breast cancer mortality in the UK over the last 2 decades despite ever-rising cancer incidence. RT in women with left-sided tumours often exposes the underlying heart to a damaging dose. The heart is very sensitive to RT, and there were 1-2 deaths from heart disease for every 100 breast cancer patients treated during the 1960s-70s. The situation has improved in recent years, but standard RT techniques still deliver significant radiation doses to heart tissue.

Two potentially simple techniques reduce heart dose. In one, women are taught to breathe in deeply and to hold their breath for about 20 seconds while RT is given. The downward movement of the diaphragm pulls the heart away from the RT beam. In the other technique, women lie on their fronts, instead of on their backs as they normally do for breast RT. In this position, the breast falls away from the rib cage and reduces exposure of the heart. Neither technique is routinely available to women receiving breast RT in the UK for reasons that this research aims to address. The investigators need to: 1) confirm that patient position can be reproduced with millimetre precision every day using these techniques, 2) minimise costs of equipment, time and personnel required to support such techniques, 3) select the most appropriate technique for different patients and 4) train staff in centres across the UK to deliver techniques safely and effectively.

Whereas urinary problems can predate surgery due to the endometrial lesions themselves, the surgery can also have functional consequences for urinary function, specifically when there is trauma (incisions, per-operative coagulation) to the inferior hypogastric nerve fibers and/or to the hypogastric plexus.

The incidence of post-surgery urinary symptoms could be as high as 30%.

NCT00942565,['Postoperative Pain'],2007-04-01,,"Patient experience moderate to severe pain after abdominal surgery. This post-operative pain can also contribute to complications such as respiratory impairment, cardiovascular events, ileus, sleep deprivation and mood disturbance. Opioid based patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is commonly employed but opioids have the side effects such as respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting, sedation, pruritus and urinary retention. Bowel motility can also be affected. Consequently alternative or adjunct analgesic medications without these side-effects have been investigated in order to reduce opioid consumption.

Multimodal analgesia is a technique whereby a combination of analgesic drugs with different modes of action can be used to improve analgesia and decrease adverse effects by virtue of synergism. Postoperatively, with adjunctive analgesia, PCA morphine consumption as well as the side effects may be reduced. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to be opioid sparing and decrease the adverse effects of PCA morphine. A recent review showed that acetaminophen combined with PCA could induce a significant opioid-sparing effect but the incidence of PCA morphine related side effects were not reduced.

It is common nowadays to give oral analgesic supplements to post-operative patients on PCA morphine. Tramadol, an analogue of codeine, is one of the choices.

Combination of tramadol 37.5 mg and acetaminophen 375 mg, which has been used successfully to treat post-operative pain, may improve analgesic response with better tolerability.

This study is to assess tramadol 37.5 mg and acetaminophen 375 mg combination on the efficacy of pain control, down stepping of morphine consumption and related adverse events with PCA use after open colorectal surgeries.

Objectives:

This study aims to compare and evaluate:

* The efficacy of tramadol/acetaminophen combination on postoperative pain relief after lower abdominal surgeries
* The effects of tramadol/acetaminophen combination on the consumption and the duration of PCA morphine use
* The adverse effects related to this regimen
* The effects on postoperative bowel function, tolerability of fluid and diet, ambulatory function, sleep, and duration of hospital stay
* The overall satisfaction of the patients",60.0,18 Years,80 Years,18.0,80.0,2007.0,4.0,2000.0,1,,,"['Postoperative Pain'] Patient experience moderate to severe pain after abdominal surgery. This post-operative pain can also contribute to complications such as respiratory impairment, cardiovascular events, ileus, sleep deprivation and mood disturbance. Opioid based patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is commonly employed but opioids have the side effects such as respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting, sedation, pruritus and urinary retention. Bowel motility can also be affected. Consequently alternative or adjunct analgesic medications without these side-effects have been investigated in order to reduce opioid consumption.

Multimodal analgesia is a technique whereby a combination of analgesic drugs with different modes of action can be used to improve analgesia and decrease adverse effects by virtue of synergism. Postoperatively, with adjunctive analgesia, PCA morphine consumption as well as the side effects may be reduced. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to be opioid sparing and decrease the adverse effects of PCA morphine. A recent review showed that acetaminophen combined with PCA could induce a significant opioid-sparing effect but the incidence of PCA morphine related side effects were not reduced.

It is common nowadays to give oral analgesic supplements to post-operative patients on PCA morphine. Tramadol, an analogue of codeine, is one of the choices. However, some of the patients cannot tolerate the side effects such as nausea, drowsiness, sweating, postural hypotension and dry mouth. Combination of tramadol 37.5 mg and acetaminophen 375 mg, which has been used successfully to treat post-operative pain, may improve analgesic response with better tolerability.

Low-grade disease is commonly noted by clinicians to be clinically insignificant cancer but remains a psychological burden to many men in this cohort. There is consensus that regular review is required for men on AS so that early treatment can be undertaken if there is disease progression, and to support men living with a cancer diagnosis. Some AS protocols, including National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), advocate the use of MRI as a regular part of the monitoring pathway.

NCT03838822,['Healthy'],,2018-11-01,"There is a strong correlation between major adverse health consequences of obesity and development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is characterized by abnormal hepatic accumulation of triglycerides and other lipids. It has become a worldwide health problem that accelerates cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and especially premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

The plasma level of glutathione (GSH) is typically depleted in individuals with metabolism related disorders. However, cellular GSH levels cannot be increased by supplementing GSH and it must be synthesized within the liver either de novo or by salvation pathway. The level of GSH is not enough to maintain and regulate the thiol redox status of the liver in subjects with high hepatic steatosis at fasting stage due to the depletion of glycine. Glycine can be synthesized via the interconversion of serine. It has been shown that the serine synthesis is downregulated in patients with NAFLD and supplementation of serine has attenuated alcoholic fatty liver by enhancing homocysteine metabolism in mice and rats. Depleted liver glutathione is also restored by the administration of N-acetylcystein as in acetaminophen poising.

NAFLD is characterized by abnormal hepatic accumulation of triglycerides and other lipids. It has become a worldwide health problem that accelerates cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and especially premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

The plasma level of glutathione (GSH) is typically depleted in individuals with metabolism related disorders. However, cellular GSH levels cannot be increased by supplementing GSH and it must be synthesized within the liver either de novo or by salvation pathway. The level of GSH is not enough to maintain and regulate the thiol redox status of the liver in subjects with high hepatic steatosis at fasting stage due to the depletion of glycine. Glycine can be synthesized via the interconversion of serine. It has been shown that the serine synthesis is downregulated in patients with NAFLD and supplementation of serine has attenuated alcoholic fatty liver by enhancing homocysteine metabolism in mice and rats. Depleted liver glutathione is also restored by the administration of N-acetylcystein as in acetaminophen poising. L-carnitine and nicotinamide that both stimulate the transfer of fatty acids from cytosol to mitochondria have been identified as two additional cofactors that are depleted in patients with NAFLD.

The treatment management of single BM remains controversial. Indeed, even though it is widely accepted that local treatment increases the median survival time in patients having a good prognostic status, the adding of ""adjuvant"" whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is currently subject to controversy, due to its potential toxicity. Yet, two randomized trials have demonstrated a clear increase in intra-cerebral recurrence and in death from neurologic origin in case of absence of ""adjuvant"" WBRT, without change in overall survival (but overall survival was not a primary endpoint in any of these studies).

The data from literature on cognitive toxicity (CT) of WBRT on BM are scarce and sometimes controversial. CT of WBRT affects the subcortical frontal functions. It is postulated that the alteration of hippocampal neurogenesis (mainly due to inflammation process), situated in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, has an essential role in the development of these brain dysfunctions.

It has been shown that the incidence of BM in the hippocampal region (hippocampus + 5mm expansion) is low, in the range of 8,6%.

New irradiation techniques, in particular intensity-modulated radiotherapy associated with rotational radiotherapy, allow to modulate the dose on an intra-cerebral structure, all the while distributing an adapted dose to the remaining brain.

This prospective, randomized study, will compare, through a battery of neuropsychological tests, the cognitive impact of WBRT of 40 Gy in 20 fractions with or without hippocampal avoidance by intensity modulated radiotherapy, in patients presenting with a single operated brain metastasis of breast cancer. If the hippocampal avoidance leads to a significant improvement in cognitive function, this radiotherapy scheme could become the standard postoperative treatment to be proposed to patients presenting the best prognostic factors. This would allow to prevent long-term cognitive deficit, while preserving WBRT benefit on intra-cerebral control.

Thus, unnecessary surgeries will be performed in 75 to 90% of cases (no cancer).
2. These breast lesions confer long-term increase in the subsequent risk of breast cancer (cumulative incidence of 15 to 25% at 25 years). Thus, women identified with atypical lesions are then followed using clinical and mammographic annual evaluation.

Based on a large retrospective study at Gustave Roussy, a prediction model (Nomat) has been developed, common to all atypical lesions, which can predict the presence of a BC at excision surgery (risk of concurrent BC).

Sunitinib is already approved by the FDA, EMEA and AEMPS for the treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinomas and those with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) with progression or intolerance to imatinib.

Suntinib has recently reported to be superior than placebo in terms of response rate (9.3% vs. 0%; p\<0.05), progression free survival (11.4 vs. 5,5 months; HR 0.41;p\<0.05), and overall survival (HR 0.40;p\<0.05) when administered in a phase 3 trial to patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).

This is where the placenta is not delivered spontaneously after giving birth. It is a major cause of postpartum haemorrhage (major loss of blood) which can lead to the death of the mother. The recommended treatment for RP is a surgical procedure - manual removal of placenta (MROP). This is a painful and unpleasant intervention for the women, involving additional hospital stay, and is an expensive outcome for the NHS. It is widely recognised that non-surgical management options for RP are limited and it has been recommended that research is needed into new medical treatments for RP.

NCT00697957,['Osteoporosis'],2002-05-01,,"Ageing populations have made osteoporosis and fragility fractures a major public health concern worldwide. Half of all women and 30% of all men will suffer a fracture related to osteoporosis during their lifetime. While medical prevention of this immense problem is impossible at population level, it is necessary to find efficient preventive strategies. Exercise is one of the major prevention approaches because one reason behind the increasing burden of osteoporosis is the modern sedentary lifestyle. However, the optimal type, intensity, frequency, and duration of exercise that best enhances skeletal integrity are still largely unknown.

We conducted a 12-month population-based randomized controlled exercise intervention in 120 premenopausal women. The aim was to investigate the effect of impact exercise on bone mineral density, geometry and metabolism in healthy women with the intention of assessing the intensity and amount of impact loading with a novel accelerometer-based measurement device. Training effects on risk factors of osteoporotic fractures, physical performance and risk factors of cardiovascular diseases were also evaluated.

This study demonstrated that 12 months of regular impact exercise favoured bone formation, increased bone mineral density in weight-bearing bones, especially at the hip, and led to geometric adaptations by increasing periosteal circumference. Bone adaptations had a dose- and intensity-dependent relationship with measured impact loading. Changes in proximal femur were threshold-dependent, indicating the importance of high impacts exceeding acceleration of 4 g as an osteogenic stimulus. The number of impacts needed to achieve this stimulation was 60 per day. Impact exercise also had a favourable effect on physical performance and cardiorespiratory risk factors by increasing maximal oxygen uptake, dynamic leg strength and decreasing low-density lipoproteins and waist circumference. Changes were dose-dependent with impact loading at wide intensity range.

To asses the efficacy of a 4 week low-intensity resistance training program with concurrent application of PBFR to the exercising limbs to improve quadriceps strength and size, leg muscle power, and mobility in individuals at risk for developing symptomatic knee osteoarthritis,we will test the following hypotheses. In comparison with low-intensity resistance training without use of PBFR, a four-week low-intensity resistance-training program with PBFR will:

Primary Hypothesis: Increase (a) double leg-press 1RM strength and (b) isokinetic knee extensor strength

Secondary Hypotheses:

1. Increase quadriceps muscle volume assessed by MRI
2. Increase lower limb muscle power on (a) double leg-press at 40% 1RM and (b) a timed stair climb
3. Not adversely effect knee pain or quality of life assessed by the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire"

The primary outcome measure will be change in pain intensity measured before and after each treatment. Data on other menstrual symptoms will be collected by telephone or a web-based survey. Three additional participants will be recruited to receive vitamin K1 injection into an acupuncture point and have blood samples drawn before and after injection to determine absorption of vitamin K1. The aims of the study are to collect preliminary data on the efficacy and safety of vitamin K1 injected in an acupoint for the treatment of severe primary dysmenorrhea; assess the feasibility and acceptability of the treatment among U.S. women; and test the blood absorption of vitamin K1 following acupoint injection treatment.

The investigators hypothesize that:

1. Vitamin K1 acupoint injection is a safe treatment for women with menstrual pain.

NCT00434265,['Obesity'],2007-03-01,,"Obesity is the consequence of a chronic disequilibrium of fat balance. Genetic factors determine predisposition to obesity, but the most often mentioned idea is that environmental factors, such as a high-fat diet and a sedentary lifestyle, join to favour weight gain and explain the increased prevalence of obesity in our westernized societies. Since lipogenesis is negligible in humans, obesity represents the consequence of altered fat partitioning between oxidation and storage, likely due to a preferential directing of dietary fat towards adipose tissue and away from muscle.

The first line agent used in the prevention and treatment of PPH is oxytocin, which acts by binding with oxytocin receptors (OTR) found on myometrial cells to cause uterine contraction.

Women who require augmentation of labour with oxytocin because of inadequate labour progression are at increased risk of PPH because they have received intravenous oxytocin which exposes the uterus (and OTR) to doses greater than would normally be found without medical intervention. This exposure results in OTR desensitization and decreased uterine sensitivity to oxytocin which may lead to the use of much higher doses of oxytocin (up to 9x) or other agents for preventing and treating PPH with the potential for causing serious drug-related morbidity or fatality to the mother.

Currently, in women who have failed labour augmentation and need to have a Cesarean delivery, it is not known if it would be beneficial to wait a certain period of time after discontinuing intravenous oxytocin before proceeding with the operation.

NCT01961336,['Subfertility'],2013-10-01,,"Ιt has been suggested that the accumulation of androgens in the micro milieu of the primate ovary, plays a critical role in early follicular development and granulosa cell proliferation. Increased intraovarian concentration of androgens seems to augment follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptor expression in granulosa cells and thus, potentially leading to enhanced responsiveness of ovaries to FSH. In addition, androgen excess has been shown to stimulate early stages of follicular growth and increase the number of pre-antral and antral follicles.

On the basis of these data, it has been hypothesized that increasing androgen concentration in the ovarian micro milieu in poorly responding patients might lead to an increase in the number and the maturity of oocytes after ovarian stimulation for IVF. Hence, recent efforts have been focused on the potential benefit of androgen administration in the probability of pregnancy in poor responders undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF.

Pretreatment with transdermal testosterone has been suggested as a safe and effective way of increasing the intraovarian androgen concentration. Recently, published, randomized control trials (RCTs) have evaluated transdermal testosterone in poor responders undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF, with inconclusive results.

In view of the conflicting or inconclusive data regarding the efficacy of the proposed intervention, this study will attempt to explore the role of transdermal testosterone pretreatment in poor responders undergoing IVF through a properly designed RCT. The lack of a universal definition of poor responders has been identified previously and recently, in an attempt to address this issue, universal criteria for the definition of poor ovarian response have been proposed following a consensus meeting in Bologna.

NCT01702389,['Hyperalgesia'],2012-10-01,,"Remifentanil is a rapid-acting opioid which has been widely used in pain treatment during surgery for the last 15 years 1. Remifentanil is rapidly eliminated (minutes) from the body after end of infusion, and this makes it easily manageable compared to other opioids. However, there are both experimental and clinical studies indicating that remifentanil, after end of infusion, triggers increased pain sensation and increased opioid consumption post-operatively. Increased post-operative opioid consumption should be avoided due to the adverse effects of these drugs (nausea/vomiting, pruritus, dizziness, fatigue and reduced respiratory rate). Thus, it's important to investigate relevant strategies to avoid the increased pain sensation (opioid-induced hyperalgesia = hypersensitivity to pain stimuli) after end of infusion of remifentanil after surgery. Several experimental and clinical trials have been conducted in this field. Ketamine has been shown to block this effect, but its adverse effect profile (i.a. hallucinations) makes it not suitable in normal clinical use. In a study of healthy volunteers, it has been demonstrated that parecoxib (a COX-2 selective NSAID) can prevent remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia. Our group has previously shown that a relatively COX-1 selective NSAID (ketorolac) can prevent hyperalgesia in an experimental pain model.

This is of interest since NSAIDs are frequently administered as premedication before surgery. There are several disadvantages associated with the use of COX-2 inhibitors, e.g. the risk of myocardial infarction after long-term use (\> 1 year), and potentially reduced bone healing after orthopedic surgery. However, this has not been shown with short-term use (days/week). The disadvantages associated with the use of e.g. ketorolac (a COX-1 inhibitor) are i.a. increased bleeding tendency, which is unfavourable for the surgeon, and increased risk of gastric ulcer. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate other ways of preventing opioid-induced hyperalgesia. In a recent animal study it has been shown that gradual dose reduction of remifentanil (vs. abrupt withdrawal of a relatively high remifentanil dose) can prevent the development of hyperalgesia after end of infusion.

There has been a relative dearth of research dedicated to understanding these health disparities between gay/bisexual and heterosexual youth, and even less has focused on identifying factors that might promote resilience against negative health outcomes. Understanding both risk factors and processes of resilience is critical in developing efficacious interventions to improve health in this population.

Through a grant from the National Institutes of Health, the investigators completed formative research with young male couples. Qualitative interviews identified preferences for couples-based intervention format and content. While coupled YMSM expressed some interest in HIV prevention, participants were most interested in building relationship skills. Coupled YMSM preferred group-based interventions in order to meet and learn from other couples but had concerns about discussing personal topics in groups. Quantitative analyses found that the rate of condomless sex in couples increased from adolescence to young adulthood. Further, the influence of older partners, partner violence, and drinking before sex were strongest in emerging adulthood. Informed by these, the research team developed 2GETHER, which aims to reduce HIV transmission risk in couples by enhancing relationship functioning. 2GETHER is a four session program.

The research project will consist of 3 separate experimental trials: (a) poikilocapnic hyperthermia (increased core temperature; decrease CBF; decrease PETCO2), (b) isocapnic hyperthermia (increased core temperature; no change CBF; no change PETCO2) and (c) isocapnic hyperthermia + indomethacin (increased core temperature; decrease CBF; no change PETCO2). During each manipulation, neuromuscular function will be evaluated and compared to baseline (normothermic) conditions using a repeated measures design.

It is hypothesized that changes in PETCO2 and therefore, changes in cerebral alkalosis will contribute to neuromuscular fatigue independent of changes in CBF or increases in core temperature."

Much accumulating evidence suggests that sensitivity to gluten may be related to symptoms or etiology in schizophrenia and that gluten free diets may lead to significant symptom resolution, but only in patients who are known to have antibodies to gluten.

Gluten sensitivity may be more common than thought and stems from a different etiology and symptom presentation than Celiac Disease. The investigators analysis of the CATIE sample show that about 23% of persons with schizophrenia (compared to 3% of healthy controls) have Gluten Sensitivity (about 300,000 persons in the United States) through the identification of gliadin positive antibodies in their blood. The investigators hypothesize that people with this biomarker could have robust symptom improvements with the removal of the antigen from the diet (gluten). If only half of people with schizophrenia and these antibodies were to substantially benefit from removal of gluten from the diet, as in the case studies and with certain subjects in the clinical trials, this would provide a new transformative treatment option for an identifiable subpopulation of people with schizophrenia and would be of enormous benefit to patients, families and society. Another benefit to the public's health from this study will be enhanced knowledge of the etiology of schizophrenia, including possible linkages between neuropsychiatric disease and immune system activation, and identification of novel, immune-linked treatment targets.

The results of this research could lead to screening for Anti-Gliadin Antibodies early in life or at the first episode of schizophrenia, as recommended by some already. Screening involves financial and emotional costs, and better evidence is needed before this recommendation can be justified. Moreover, a new treatment paradigm of removing gluten from the diet by means of gluten blocking medications (already in early study) could advance treatment significantly.

During endurance exercise, muscle glycogen is used as fuel for the working muscles and liver glycogen is broken down to provide glucose to maintain blood glucose (sugar) levels. Both liver and muscle glycogen are important for our ability to perform intense/prolonged endurance exercise. Therefore, it is important to replete these stores after an intense/prolonged endurance exercise session in order to recover and perform optimally during a subsequent exercise bout, especially if the next exercise session is within 24h (e.g. stage races such as the Tour de France, tournament-style competitions such as the Olympic games and ultra-endurance events).

Carbohydrate intake has been shown to increase the availability of glycogen in the muscle and liver after exercise. The carbohydrates typically found in sports drinks are glucose and sometimes fructose. It has been observed that the ingestion of glucose will lead to a maximum rate of absorption of approximately \~1 g/min. However, if we also provide a different source of carbohydrate (fructose) then this is absorbed through a different pathway and therefore we can absorb up to \~1.75 g/min of carbohydrate.

NCT02270619,['Depression'],2014-10-01,,"Late-life depression is a major public health burden due to its high prevalence and associated morbidity, suicide risk, functional decline, and mortality. Unfortunately, current antidepressant therapies have limited effectiveness; hence, biologically plausible models for new treatments are being pursued. Systemic inflammation is hypothesized to play an important role on the onset and perpetuation of depression, especially in older women. Aging processes involve a heightened inflammatory state, and both inflammatory disorders and depression are more prevalent in women than men. However, increased systemic inflammation does not necessarily lead to depression in all women. Even when robust systemic inflammation is experimentally induced (e.g. endotoxin administration), largely variable increases in depressive symptoms are found. Defining the factors that account for this variability may identify individuals at risk of developing depression when exposed to heightened inflammatory states such as aging, obesity, and chronic disease, and informs future translational studies of depression prevention. In particular, the role of sleep disturbance in explaining this variability requires further attention because it is an independent risk factor for depression and heightens systemic inflammation by increasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines. The investigators have also discovered that women, but not men, who report sleep disturbance including short sleep duration experience significantly more depressive symptoms in response to an inflammatory challenge than women without sleep disturbance. Thus, it is hypothesized that sleep loss is a vulnerability factor for inflammation-induced depressive symptoms in women.

NCT00934999,['Urinary Incontinence'],2009-06-01,,"I. Specific Aims

Pelvic organ prolapse is a common and distressing condition that is frequently associated with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and often requires surgical repair. Abdominal sacral colpopexy is the preferred operation for repairing pelvic prolapse. As many as 91% of women with pelvic organ prolapse undergoing sacral colpopexy also experience SUI. In addition, up to 44% of previously continent women develop SUI incontinence after sacral colpopexy: perhaps because a sacral colpopexy may predispose to opening of the bladder neck if secured too tightly. The selection of a surgical procedure to prevent and manage SUI in women undergoing sacral colpopexy is empiric rather than evidence-based. Conceptually, a mid-urethral sling may be more effective than a Burch procedure for preventing urinary leakage because a sling provides outlet resistance beyond the bladder neck and therefore it may compensate for a downward tension on the bladder neck resulting from the sacral colpopexy. Indeed, clinical observations suggest that a mid-urethral sling is effective among women who have persistent urinary incontinence after sacral colpopexy with a Burch procedure. Therefore, the investigators' global hypothesis is that a mid-urethral sling is preferable to a Burch procedure for preventing and improving stress urinary incontinence in women undergoing sacral colpopexy for pelvic organ prolapse. The investigators' SPECIFIC AIMS are to evaluate objective and subjective outcomes at 6, 12 and 24 months in 124 women with urinary incontinence and advanced pelvic organ prolapse. All women will be undergoing a sacral colpopexy and will be randomized to either a Burch procedure or a mid-urethral sling. The primary endpoint is composite continence at 6 months while secondary endpoints will include composite continence and subjective measures of incontinence, patient satisfaction and morbidity associated with these procedures. The investigators' hypotheses are as follows:

1. At 6 months, urinary continence rates will be higher after a mid-urethral than after a Burch procedure. Urine continence will be assessed by composite measure of incontinence: no subjective complaint, no interim treatment, and negative standardized stress test performed by a masked observer.

They are most often due to Streptococcus B (GBS) and are associated with heavy and costly morbidity and mortality. The strategy combining antenatal detection (PV9) of GBS colonization and intrapartum antibiotic therapy has led to a spectacular decrease in the number of GBS EONI's that have become rare (0.3/1000 births). Current detection is based on the culture of a vaginal swab taken between 35 and 38 SA. Because the positive predictive value of PV9 compared to a culture on the day of delivery is 60%, two problems persist: i) 20% of women and newborns are sometimes unnecessarily exposed to antibiotics with known short-term and long-term harmful effects; ii) more than half of newborns developing EONI are born to mothers with negative PV9. There is a risk of not treating intrapartum colonization when PV9 is negative, and overtreating an uncolonized PV9-positive woman at the time of delivery. These inappropriate antibiotic therapies generate additional maternal-fetal care, examinations, treatments and hospitalizations with significant costs.

Today, a feasible, rapid, sensitive (90-95%) and specific (95-98%) PCR test (Xpert GBS, CEPHEID) can be used to detect women colonized with GBS at the beginning of labor. A recent study (submitted for publication) including 782 women with risk factors for infection (intrapartum fever or prolonged rupture of membranes) who were subjected to PV9 and intrapartum PCR (IP PCR), identified 19% potential reclassification of GBS status, with a potential saving of 6% intrapartum antibiotic.

We postulate that the replacement of PV9 by the generalized use of GBS intrapartum detection would optimize the indications for intrapartum antiobiotherapy, avoiding (i) unnecessary and deleterious care consumption in the absence of intrapartum GBS colonization, and (ii) avoidable EONIs occurring in the absence of intrapartum antiobiotherapy when GBS colonization has not been diagnosed.

We propose to conduct a cost-consequence study because the criteria for clinically relevant judgments do not allow for cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analysis. Indeed, the intrapartum PCR strategy has consequences for both mother and child and these consequences cannot be aggregated.

NCT02137941,"['Stress', 'Anxiety']",2010-09-01,,"Chronic stress at work is a public health problem increasing morbidity and mortality, especially in men. Among the men military populations, the firefighters of Paris (FFPs) are particularly exposed. To deal with this stress and to improve stress management is challenging. Psychological fitness is required to regulate emotions which improve effectiveness under stress and enhance recovery from stressful events. The heart coherence (HC) program uses feedback from a simple pulse sensor to reflect changes of the emotional/psychological state, and to learn how to reduce stress and stabilize emotions. Another kind of psychological fitness focuses on cognitive training to regulate emotions, with the use of techniques to optimize potential (TOP). The TOP consists of learning easy techniques in mental skills to improve cognitive-based problem-solving using respiration, relaxation, and visualization. Although never published in a peer-review journal, the procedure of TOP training is structured and standardized for individuals and groups, and is widely practiced in air traffic controllers, with apparently good effects.

Moreover, any event can be emotionally ambiguous, providing both negative and positive outcomes. The interpretation of such ambiguity is linked with an individual's emotional state, such as anxiety or mood. Individuals with a high level of trait anxiety are likely to interpret an event negatively.

However, no studies have compared the effect of HC or TOP in the perceived stress of FFPs. Nor have long-term effects of these stress management programs (SMP) been investigated.

The hysteroscopic morcellator (HM) is a novel technique for removal of intrauterine polyps, myomas and placental tissue. It withholds some technical advantages over resectoscopy. Previous data suggest that it's a faster technique than the latter, and shows that it has a low complication rate.

Objective:

To compare the HM to bipolar resectoscopy for removal of:

1) large intrauterine polyps, 2) smaller type 0 and 1 myomas, 3) residual placental tissue, in terms of efficiency and complications.

Study design: Single blind, randomized controlled multicenter trial.

Study population: Women aged over 18 years old with:

HIOB - Hypofractionated Whole-Breast Irradiation preceded by Intraoperative Radiotherapy with Electrons as anticipated Boost ISIORT- 01

HIOB is defined as hypofractionated WBRT (40,5 Gy in 2,7 Gy per fraction) preceded by an Intraoperative Boost to the tumor bed ( 90 % reference dose of 10 Gy, 11,1 Gy Dmax IOERT).

Primary endpoint is the proof of superiority of a new treatment regimen.

The HIOB study concept is supposed to test the hypothesis whether such a combined schedule is superior (or iso-effective) towards ""standard"" RT in terms of local control and cosmetic outcome.

In the vast majority of all publications, annual and 5 year in-breast recurrence rates following BCT showed a clear dependency on patient age within the following boundaries (primary references):

Age \> 50: Bartelink (standard): 0,7% (annual) 3,5% (5y) START B (best): 0,4 %(annual) 2,0% (5y)

Indeed, patients not presenting a life threatening condition often present to the emergency department with sickle cell disease crisis related pain. Currently, the effectiveness of specific analgesic strategies for treating sickle cell disease crisis related pain are mostly based on acetaminophen and opioid derivates combination along with oxygen delivery.

NCT02562300,['Postpartum Haemorrhage'],2014-01-01,,"Postpartum haemorrhage continues to be a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide and that is according to the estimates of the World Health Organization in 1998. Average blood loss during delivery progressively increases with the type of delivery, vaginal delivery (500 ml), cesarean section (1000 ml) and emergency hysterectomy (3500 ml) of blood.

A reduction of operative blood loss at cesarean section has a great benefit to the patients in terms of decreased postoperative morbidity and a decrease in risks associated with blood transfusions. The routine use of oxytocin is associated with a significant reduction in the occurrence of postpartum hemorrhage.

Excessive blood loss as estimated by a 10% drop in the hematocrit value postdelivery or by need for blood transfusion, occurs in approximately 4% of vaginal deliveries and 6% of cesarean births.

Although many delivery units use oxytocin as the first line agent to prevent uterine atony at cesarean section, it may not be the ideal agent for prevention of postpartum haemorrhage especially in compromised patients with preeclampsia, cardiac disease or prolonged labor. Oxytocin and specifically its preservative chlorobutanol increases the heart rate and has negative inotropic, antiplatelet and antidiuretic effects.

Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analogue, has been shown in many studies to be an effective myometrial stimulant of the pregnant uterus which binds to prostanoid receptors.

Misoprostol administration, either by oral or rectal route, has been shown to be effective in prevention of postpartum haemorrhage and is considered as an effective alternative to other conventional oxytocics especially in developing countries as it is cheap and thermostable.

NCT00029757,"['Menopause', 'Postmenopause']",,,"Background: The use of estrogen in postmenopausal (or surgically menopausal) women is a common practice. Compliance is problematic in that estimates show only 1/3 of women use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and only 30% are compliant. Estrogen has many documented benefits including symptomatic relief of hot flashes, improvement of the dry vagina and dyspareunia. Estrogen has been found to improve bone mineral density and increase the high- density lipoprotein portion of a cholesterol panel. To improve compliance and to provide an alternate method of delivery, we propose the use of estrogen which is admixed in toothpaste and propose to study the absorption, rate of build-up and rate of decline.

Compliance is problematic in that estimates show only 1/3 of women use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and only 30% are compliant. Estrogen has many documented benefits including symptomatic relief of hot flashes, improvement of the dry vagina and dyspareunia. Estrogen has been found to improve bone mineral density and increase the high- density lipoprotein portion of a cholesterol panel. To improve compliance and to provide an alternate method of delivery, we propose the use of estrogen which is admixed in toothpaste and propose to study the absorption, rate of build-up and rate of decline.

This study is designed to compare the analgesic efficacy of fentanyl, sufentanil and butorphanol delivered after gynecological laparoscopic surgeries that underwent remifentanil induction and maintenance, and investigate corresponding influence on the levels of blood cortisol and β-endorphin."

* rV-PSA: Vaccinia virus plus human DNA that produces PSA (prostate specific antigen)
* rV-B7.1: Vaccinia virus plus human DNA that produces B7.1 (a protein that helps guide immune cells to their targets)
* rF-PSA: Fowlpox virus plus human DNA that produces PSA

* IL-2: Drug that boosts the immune system.

Patients 18 years of age and older with prostate cancer confined to the prostate who have received a smallpox vaccine sometime in the past and who do not have a history of allergy to eggs may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a complete medical history and physical examination, blood tests, and skin tests (similar to those for allergies or tuberculosis) to assess immune function.

Perineal trauma is classified into four degrees based on anatomic structures involved and severity of lacerations according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG) and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG). Episiotomy is an intentional perineal incision performed by midwifes or obstetricians to enlarge vaginal opening during the second stage of childbirth and has become the most common surgical procedure worldwide. A routine use of episiotomy was proposed to prevent severe spontaneous lacerations, although it failed to to demonstrate a clear protective role with no benefits both for mother and baby. Therefore the guidelines changed in a selective use of episiotomy, and we have introduced it in our routine obstetrics care. Nevertheless, second-degree lacerations comprise a wide range of lesions, from a minimal involvement to a massive damage of the perineal muscles. Therefore, it was never confirmed that selective use of episiotomy reduce the perianal trauma in the range of second degree lesions.

We designed a prospective observational study with the introduction of a new classification of perineal trauma recorded with the usual data retrieved in delivery ward register. The aim is to definitively investigate if selective use of episiotomy reduce the overall perineal trauma."

NCT02119117,"['Mitochondrial DNA', 'Aneuploidy']",2014-04-01,,"Pregnancy rates for women over 35 years old are significantly lower when compared to younger women. One of the causes for this decrease is believed to be chromosomal aneuploidy. Chromosomal aneuploidy is a natural phenomena and occurs in women of every age and has been implicated in spontaneous miscarriages, and preimplantation embryo wastage (Hassold and Hunt, 2001).

As maternal age increases, so too does the incidence of chromosomal aneuploidy. Embryo quality from older patients undergoing IVF tends to be reduced and associated with higher rates of chromosomal abnormalities when compared to good quality embryos (Munne et al., 1995).

Chromosomal aneuploidy derives from the improper segregation of chromosomes during preimplantation development. The process of segregation, or mitosis, includes synthesis of the complete genome, equal division of chromosomes to opposite poles by the spindle apparatus, and separation of the two cells by cytokinesis, yielding two chromosomally identical cells. The entire process of cellular and genetic replication requires energy in the form of adenosine tri phosphate (ATP). ATP is mainly produced in mitochondria in the process known as the electron transport chain (ETC). There are many important molecules required for ATP production, CoQ10 can act as the appropriate carrier of electrons through the ETC. When a deficiency in CoQ10 is present, ATP production is decreased resulting in aneuploidy (Bentov et al., 2013). Similarly, research has shown that chromosome alignment and spindle formation are affected by mtDNA copy number (Ge et al., 2012). It has also been shown that the transfer of ooplasm from young, healthy oocyte donors into oocytes of women with repeated embryonic failure has result in children with subsequent mitochondrial heteroplasmy (Cohen et al., 1998).

CoQ10 concentrations have been shown to decrease as age increases (Bentov et al., 2011). Consequently, the decrease in CoQ10 concentrations seen in older women may cause an increase in chromosomal aneuploidy in subsequent embryos (Bentov et al., 2013). In this pilot study, we test the hypothesis that the supplementation of CoQ10 prior to an IVF cycle can increase mitochondrial DNA activity and possibly decrease chromosomal aneuploidy in AMA patients.",21.0,36 Years,42 Years,36.0,42.0,2014.0,4.0,2010.0,2,,,"['Mitochondrial DNA', 'Aneuploidy'] Pregnancy rates for women over 35 years old are significantly lower when compared to younger women.

NCT01903031,['HIV-1 Infection'],,2016-10-03,"This study was done to look at a method of hormonal birth control, called the NuvaRing, and specific anti-HIV medications, called antiretrovirals (ARVs). Some studies of women who use a hormonal birth control method (specifically oral pills, patches, and injections) and take ARVs have shown that ARVs interact with the hormones released by the birth control medication. These interactions may cause the birth control to be less effective at preventing pregnancy. There is also concern that hormonal birth control can increase HIV spreading to others, but more studies are needed to determine if this is true. The investigators did not know whether the NuvaRing and ARVs interact when they are used together, so this study looked to see if certain ARVs (efavirenz and atazanavir/ritonavir) interact with the two hormones released by NuvaRing. This will help us to determine if NuvaRing is safe and effective for women with HIV infection who are taking ARVs.

NCT01514630,"['Depression', 'Substance Abuse', 'Substance Use', 'Neuroimaging', 'Dual Diagnosis']",2013-01-01,,"Methamphetamine (MA) is a psychostimulant drug with high abuse potential. MA can be smoked, snorted, injected or ingested orally to produce a release of high levels of dopamine into the brain and reduction of dopamine uptake. Its use results in feelings of pleasure, increased energy, and greater alertness lasting up to 12 hours. In 2010, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that 353,000 Americans aged 12 or older reported being current MA users. Over the past decade MA use rates have fluctuated with current use rates on the decline; however, importantly, even though overall use rates are declining, use rates among males and females are approaching equal proportions. This use rate pattern is unlike other drugs of abuse, which typically demonstrate males using more than females. In some states, more females than males consider MA as their drug of choice. Namely, in a 2010 report in the state of Utah, more females were diagnosed with MA as a primary substance of abuse than males upon admission to treatment.

Depression and MA use are highly comorbid. The relationship between MA use and depression is likely bidirectional, with MA use causing changes in mood and being used as a self-medicating behavior to reduce symptoms of depression. Several studies have shown that depression rates are higher in MA-using females compared to their male counterparts. It is likely that neurobiological and psychosocial mechanisms contribute to increased incidence of depressive symptoms in females.

No clear treatment model exists to suggest how the comorbidity of depression and MA use is best managed. In studies of antidepressants for treatment of MA withdrawal and dependence, findings have suggested that antidepressants are ineffective for treating depressive symptoms.

Osteoporosis is a major public health problem. One in two women and one in five men over age 50 will have a fracture. Fractures cause pain, disability and reduce life-expectancy. Women with below-average bone density around the time of the menopause might have previously taken hormone replacement (HRT) to prevent osteoporosis, but HRT is much less used now due to side effects. Therefore there is a need for safe, effective and inexpensive preventative interventions for women at risk of osteoporosis.

Selenium is a chemical nutrient present in several human proteins, including anti-oxidants. Anti-oxidants may protect against ageing of tissues, including bone, by mopping up damaging reactive oxygen molecules (sometimes called 'free radicals'). Selenium is present in soil, and so is obtained from many foods. However, soil selenium levels are low in Europe, and dietary intake in the UK is below recommended levels.

NCT04169334,"['Depression, Postpartum']",,2022-01-21,"It is well documented that the formation of the early relation between parents and infant has a significant impact on the child's mental, social and cognitive development and competencies. The early relationship formation in the first year in the infants' life gets the best conditions when parents are able to interpret, understand and respond to the infants signal adequately. Symptoms of mental illness can affect a person's ability to respond to their environment and thereby their parenting capabilities. Research have found that parental psychopathology may interfere with a healthy interaction with the infant by reducing the ability to be sensitively attuned and responsive to the infant's signal, needs and cues due to the nature of the psychiatric symptoms.

The aim of this study is to investigate what potential lies within the postpartum stay at the obstetric department and in the transition to the primary health care sector for vulnerable families and to develop an intervention that will help increase the parents sensitivity towards their new born infant in order to enter a healthy early relationship formation which will be measureable on short term in the prevalence of maternal post-partum depression.

The study is a prospective mixed-method study consisting of three sub-studies. The first study is a register-based study which aims to investigate how the proportion and the absolute risk of children with predefined adverse developmental outcomes is distributed between families defined as level three or four compared to families defined as level one and two. The second study aims to uncover needs and preferences of the vulnerable families and to investigate the experiences of the health care professionals. It is explored by in-depth family interviews with families discharged from the obstetric department and focus group interviews with health care professionals (nurses and health visitors) who are responsible for the care delivered to vulnerable families. Subsequently an intervention study will be developed, adapted, implemented and evaluated. The intervention will be carried out at the obstetric department at Hvidovre hospital and in transition to the primary healthcare sector using components from family focused nursing (FFN) and neonatal behavioral observational sessions (NBO) in addition to what have appeared in the two first sub-studies. The aim of the intervention is to facilitate family consciousness of their resources'' and increase parental sensitivity in order to foster the best possible prerequisites for a healthy early relationship formation between parent and infant.

The study population consists of mothers with anxiety or depression diagnosis giving birth at Hvidovre hospital.

The register-based study will provide population based information on the characteristics of vulnerable families focusing on the adverse outcomes for the children. The qualitative interviews will contribute with in-depth knowledge about preferences and experiences in relation to the care offered within the extended stay at the obstetric department and in the transition to primary health care sector and everyday life for vulnerable families.

The enactment, implementation and evaluation of the intervention will determine whether the combination of FFN, NBO and improved collaboration between the obstetric department and the health visitor is associated with increased family function and increased parental sensitivity among parents in the intervention group compared to the control group. Effect from baseline (24-48 hours post-partum) to follow-up (3 months post-partum) will be measured on both the mother, the parents and the infant focusing on depression symptoms (primary outcome), parental stress, parental reflective function, mother-baby interaction, couple relationship satisfaction, infants' self-regulation, family function and breastfeeding Descriptive statistics will be applied in order to detect associations. Power calculations showed that with a significance level of 5% and a power of 80% 55 families are needed in the control and the intervention group, respectively, in order to detect statistically difference.

NCT01048424,"['Urinary Incontinence, Urge']",2010-01-01,,"Urgency incontinence is a common and burdensome problem in women. Current treatments for this condition, while effective, are associated with potentially disabling side effects and high rates of discontinuation. There is an urgent need for alternate treatments for urgency incontinence that are both clinically effective and well-tolerated by women in the community.

RESPeRATE is a commercially available ""walkman-like"" device that measures chest/abdominal excursion during respiration using an elastic belt with a sensor placed around the torso over clothing. The device senses respiration and uses musical tones keyed to inhalation and exhalation to help the user slow respiration and prolong exhalation to a recommended goal of less than 10 breaths per minute.

NCT03135314,"['Hypoxia, Altitude']",,2016-07-30,"Not uncommonly, sports events take place or finish at high altitude, where physical and cognitive (e.g. decision-making, motor control) performance in hypoxia is determining the outcome of sports performance. With nutritional supplements growing in popularity in the athletic and non-athletic population, research is increasingly focussing on dietary constituents which can improve cognitive and exercise performance.

Flavonoids, a subgroup of polyphenols, are a class of natural compounds found in the human diet and include subcategories of flavanols, flavonols, iso-flavones, flavones, and anthocyanidins. Intake of flavanols, found in grapes, tea, red wine, apples and especially cocoa, causes an nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilatation and can improve peripheral and cerebral blood flow (CBF).

For cocoa flavanol (CF), there is evidence that both long term and acute intake can improve cognitive function, with the quantity and bioavailability of the consumed CF highly influencing its beneficial effects and with higher doses eliciting greater effects on cognition. Increased CBF following acute and chronic (3 months) CF intake has been demonstrated in healthy young subjects. Moreover, cognitive performance and mood during sustained mental efforts are improved after acute CF intake in healthy subjects and CF intake can increase prefrontal oxygenation during cognitive tasks in well-trained athletes. Moreover, CF intake is not only associated with an improved blood flow, but it might also improve exercise performance following 2 weeks of dark chocolate intake. On top of that, CF is known to have anti-oxidant properties and 2 week CF intake has been associated with reduced oxidative-stress markers following exercise.

In hypoxic conditions, arterial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and arterial saturation of O2 (SaO2) are decreased, compromising tissue oxygen delivery. Since brain function and brain integrity are dependent on continuous oxygen supply, brain desaturation may result in an impaired cognitive function in hypoxia. The severity of the impairment is related to the extent of high altitude, with at 3000m (=14.3 % oxygen (O2); = 71% of oxygen available at sea level) psychomotor impairments being visible. Cerebral oxygenation, which can be measured by Near-infrared spectroscopy, is lowered in hypoxia.

It remains unclear whether CF intake can influence cerebral oxygenation and perfusion in hypoxic conditions and whether CF intake could (partially) counteract hypoxia-induced cognitive impairments. Therefore, the first aim of this study was to investigate whether cognitive function and prefrontal oxygenation during a mental demanding task will be impaired by hypoxic conditions (3000m altitude; 14.3% O2) and whether these impairments can be partially restored by subchronic CF intake (7 days, 900 mg/day).

Hypoxia also impairs physical performance. Hypoxia-induced reductions in cerebral oxygenation may favour central fatigue, i.e. the failure of the central nervous system to excite the motoneurons adequately, hence impairing exercise performance in hypoxic conditions. Since hypoxia also impairs oxygen delivery to muscle tissue, the decreased oxygen supply to and impaired oxidative energy production in the exercising muscle is a second factor negatively affecting exercise performance.

Besides the aforementioned effects of altitude on O2 delivery, hypoxia also results in increased oxidative stress. Oxidative stress refers to the imbalance between prooxidant and antioxidant levels in favor of prooxidants in cells and tissues and can result from diminished antioxidant levels or increased production of reactive oxygen species. The latter can be induced by both exhaustive exercise and high altitude. Since oxidative stress can be counteracted by CF, we also aim to investigate how markers of oxidative stress can be affected by CF intake by exercise in hypoxia. Therefore, the second aim of this study was to investigate possible beneficial effects of CF intake on changes in cerebral and muscle vasoreactivity and oxidative stress during exercise in hypoxia and its implications on exercise performance.",15.0,18 Years,36 Years,18.0,36.0,,,,2,,,"['Hypoxia, Altitude'] Not uncommonly, sports events take place or finish at high altitude, where physical and cognitive (e.g. decision-making, motor control) performance in hypoxia is determining the outcome of sports performance. With nutritional supplements growing in popularity in the athletic and non-athletic population, research is increasingly focussing on dietary constituents which can improve cognitive and exercise performance.

Flavonoids, a subgroup of polyphenols, are a class of natural compounds found in the human diet and include subcategories of flavanols, flavonols, iso-flavones, flavones, and anthocyanidins. Intake of flavanols, found in grapes, tea, red wine, apples and especially cocoa, causes an nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilatation and can improve peripheral and cerebral blood flow (CBF).

For cocoa flavanol (CF), there is evidence that both long term and acute intake can improve cognitive function, with the quantity and bioavailability of the consumed CF highly influencing its beneficial effects and with higher doses eliciting greater effects on cognition. Increased CBF following acute and chronic (3 months) CF intake has been demonstrated in healthy young subjects. Moreover, cognitive performance and mood during sustained mental efforts are improved after acute CF intake in healthy subjects and CF intake can increase prefrontal oxygenation during cognitive tasks in well-trained athletes. Moreover, CF intake is not only associated with an improved blood flow, but it might also improve exercise performance following 2 weeks of dark chocolate intake. On top of that, CF is known to have anti-oxidant properties and 2 week CF intake has been associated with reduced oxidative-stress markers following exercise.

In hypoxic conditions, arterial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and arterial saturation of O2 (SaO2) are decreased, compromising tissue oxygen delivery. Since brain function and brain integrity are dependent on continuous oxygen supply, brain desaturation may result in an impaired cognitive function in hypoxia. The severity of the impairment is related to the extent of high altitude, with at 3000m (=14.3 % oxygen (O2); = 71% of oxygen available at sea level) psychomotor impairments being visible. Cerebral oxygenation, which can be measured by Near-infrared spectroscopy, is lowered in hypoxia.

It remains unclear whether CF intake can influence cerebral oxygenation and perfusion in hypoxic conditions and whether CF intake could (partially) counteract hypoxia-induced cognitive impairments. Therefore, the first aim of this study was to investigate whether cognitive function and prefrontal oxygenation during a mental demanding task will be impaired by hypoxic conditions (3000m altitude; 14.3% O2) and whether these impairments can be partially restored by subchronic CF intake (7 days, 900 mg/day).

Hypoxia also impairs physical performance. Hypoxia-induced reductions in cerebral oxygenation may favour central fatigue, i.e. the failure of the central nervous system to excite the motoneurons adequately, hence impairing exercise performance in hypoxic conditions. Since hypoxia also impairs oxygen delivery to muscle tissue, the decreased oxygen supply to and impaired oxidative energy production in the exercising muscle is a second factor negatively affecting exercise performance.

Besides the aforementioned effects of altitude on O2 delivery, hypoxia also results in increased oxidative stress. Oxidative stress refers to the imbalance between prooxidant and antioxidant levels in favor of prooxidants in cells and tissues and can result from diminished antioxidant levels or increased production of reactive oxygen species. The latter can be induced by both exhaustive exercise and high altitude. Since oxidative stress can be counteracted by CF, we also aim to investigate how markers of oxidative stress can be affected by CF intake by exercise in hypoxia. Therefore, the second aim of this study was to investigate possible beneficial effects of CF intake on changes in cerebral and muscle vasoreactivity and oxidative stress during exercise in hypoxia and its implications on exercise performance."

NCT02744300,['Gestational Diabetes Mellitus'],2016-09-01,2019-07-29,"Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. In our 2012 pilot study we created and tested a web-based lifestyle intervention program adapted from the NIH sponsored Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), modified specifically for women with a recent history of GDM. This program, delivered in the first year postpartum, encouraged weight loss, dietary changes, and physical activity. The purpose of the current study, called Balance After Baby Intervention 2 (BABI-2), is to study a larger group of women with two years of follow-up. We will assess whether women assigned to the intervention group lose more weight and decrease their risk factors for type 2 diabetes.

Participants assigned to the BAB lifestyle intervention will receive support from a lifestyle coach and gain access to a website with online presentations that contain healthy eating and physical activity educational tips.

Participants assigned to the post-GDM follow-up group will have access to a website containing links to information about diabetes prevention.",180.0,18 Years,,18.0,,2016.0,9.0,2010.0,1,1061.0,2.91,"['Gestational Diabetes Mellitus'] Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.
